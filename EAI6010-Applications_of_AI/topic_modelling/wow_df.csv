36,THE EVE OF THE WAR.,The War of the Worlds_1
36,,The War of the Worlds_1
36,,The War of the Worlds_1
36,No one would have believed in the last years of the nineteenth century,The War of the Worlds_1
36,that this world was being watched keenly and closely by intelligences,The War of the Worlds_1
36,greater than man’s and yet as mortal as his own; that as men busied,The War of the Worlds_1
36,themselves about their various concerns they were scrutinised and,The War of the Worlds_1
36,"studied, perhaps almost as narrowly as a man with a microscope might",The War of the Worlds_1
36,scrutinise the transient creatures that swarm and multiply in a drop of,The War of the Worlds_1
36,water. With infinite complacency men went to and fro over this globe,The War of the Worlds_1
36,"about their little affairs, serene in their assurance of their empire",The War of the Worlds_1
36,over matter. It is possible that the infusoria under the microscope do,The War of the Worlds_1
36,the same. No one gave a thought to the older worlds of space as sources,The War of the Worlds_1
36,"of human danger, or thought of them only to dismiss the idea of life",The War of the Worlds_1
36,upon them as impossible or improbable. It is curious to recall some of,The War of the Worlds_1
36,the mental habits of those departed days. At most terrestrial men,The War of the Worlds_1
36,"fancied there might be other men upon Mars, perhaps inferior to",The War of the Worlds_1
36,themselves and ready to welcome a missionary enterprise. Yet across the,The War of the Worlds_1
36,"gulf of space, minds that are to our minds as ours are to those of the",The War of the Worlds_1
36,"beasts that perish, intellects vast and cool and unsympathetic,",The War of the Worlds_1
36,"regarded this earth with envious eyes, and slowly and surely drew their",The War of the Worlds_1
36,plans against us. And early in the twentieth century came the great,The War of the Worlds_1
36,disillusionment.,The War of the Worlds_1
36,,The War of the Worlds_1
36,"The planet Mars, I scarcely need remind the reader, revolves about the",The War of the Worlds_1
36,"sun at a mean distance of 140,000,000 miles, and the light and heat it",The War of the Worlds_1
36,receives from the sun is barely half of that received by this world. It,The War of the Worlds_1
36,"must be, if the nebular hypothesis has any truth, older than our world;",The War of the Worlds_1
36,"and long before this earth ceased to be molten, life upon its surface",The War of the Worlds_1
36,must have begun its course. The fact that it is scarcely one seventh of,The War of the Worlds_1
36,the volume of the earth must have accelerated its cooling to the,The War of the Worlds_1
36,temperature at which life could begin. It has air and water and all,The War of the Worlds_1
36,that is necessary for the support of animated existence.,The War of the Worlds_1
36,,The War of the Worlds_1
36,"Yet so vain is man, and so blinded by his vanity, that no writer, up to",The War of the Worlds_1
36,"the very end of the nineteenth century, expressed any idea that",The War of the Worlds_1
36,"intelligent life might have developed there far, or indeed at all,",The War of the Worlds_1
36,beyond its earthly level. Nor was it generally understood that since,The War of the Worlds_1
36,"Mars is older than our earth, with scarcely a quarter of the",The War of the Worlds_1
36,"superficial area and remoter from the sun, it necessarily follows that",The War of the Worlds_1
36,it is not only more distant from time’s beginning but nearer its end.,The War of the Worlds_1
36,,The War of the Worlds_1
36,The secular cooling that must someday overtake our planet has already,The War of the Worlds_1
36,gone far indeed with our neighbour. Its physical condition is still,The War of the Worlds_1
36,"largely a mystery, but we know now that even in its equatorial region",The War of the Worlds_1
36,the midday temperature barely approaches that of our coldest winter.,The War of the Worlds_1
36,"Its air is much more attenuated than ours, its oceans have shrunk until",The War of the Worlds_1
36,"they cover but a third of its surface, and as its slow seasons change",The War of the Worlds_1
36,huge snowcaps gather and melt about either pole and periodically,The War of the Worlds_1
36,"inundate its temperate zones. That last stage of exhaustion, which to",The War of the Worlds_1
36,"us is still incredibly remote, has become a present-day problem for the",The War of the Worlds_1
36,inhabitants of Mars. The immediate pressure of necessity has brightened,The War of the Worlds_1
36,"their intellects, enlarged their powers, and hardened their hearts. And",The War of the Worlds_1
36,"looking across space with instruments, and intelligences such as we",The War of the Worlds_1
36,"have scarcely dreamed of, they see, at its nearest distance only",The War of the Worlds_1
36,"35,000,000 of miles sunward of them, a morning star of hope, our own",The War of the Worlds_1
36,"warmer planet, green with vegetation and grey with water, with a cloudy",The War of the Worlds_1
36,"atmosphere eloquent of fertility, with glimpses through its drifting",The War of the Worlds_1
36,"cloud wisps of broad stretches of populous country and narrow,",The War of the Worlds_1
36,navy-crowded seas.,The War of the Worlds_1
36,,The War of the Worlds_1
36,"And we men, the creatures who inhabit this earth, must be to them at",The War of the Worlds_1
36,least as alien and lowly as are the monkeys and lemurs to us. The,The War of the Worlds_1
36,intellectual side of man already admits that life is an incessant,The War of the Worlds_1
36,"struggle for existence, and it would seem that this too is the belief",The War of the Worlds_1
36,of the minds upon Mars. Their world is far gone in its cooling and this,The War of the Worlds_1
36,"world is still crowded with life, but crowded only with what they",The War of the Worlds_1
36,"regard as inferior animals. To carry warfare sunward is, indeed, their",The War of the Worlds_1
36,"only escape from the destruction that, generation after generation,",The War of the Worlds_1
36,creeps upon them.,The War of the Worlds_1
36,,The War of the Worlds_1
36,And before we judge of them too harshly we must remember what ruthless,The War of the Worlds_1
36,"and utter destruction our own species has wrought, not only upon",The War of the Worlds_1
36,"animals, such as the vanished bison and the dodo, but upon its inferior",The War of the Worlds_1
36,"races. The Tasmanians, in spite of their human likeness, were entirely",The War of the Worlds_1
36,swept out of existence in a war of extermination waged by European,The War of the Worlds_1
36,"immigrants, in the space of fifty years. Are we such apostles of mercy",The War of the Worlds_1
36,as to complain if the Martians warred in the same spirit?,The War of the Worlds_1
36,,The War of the Worlds_1
36,The Martians seem to have calculated their descent with amazing,The War of the Worlds_1
36,subtlety—their mathematical learning is evidently far in excess of,The War of the Worlds_1
36,ours—and to have carried out their preparations with a well-nigh,The War of the Worlds_1
36,"perfect unanimity. Had our instruments permitted it, we might have seen",The War of the Worlds_1
36,the gathering trouble far back in the nineteenth century. Men like,The War of the Worlds_1
36,"Schiaparelli watched the red planet—it is odd, by-the-bye, that for",The War of the Worlds_1
36,countless centuries Mars has been the star of war—but failed to,The War of the Worlds_1
36,interpret the fluctuating appearances of the markings they mapped so,The War of the Worlds_1
36,well. All that time the Martians must have been getting ready.,The War of the Worlds_1
36,,The War of the Worlds_1
36,During the opposition of 1894 a great light was seen on the illuminated,The War of the Worlds_1
36,"part of the disk, first at the Lick Observatory, then by Perrotin of",The War of the Worlds_1
36,"Nice, and then by other observers. English readers heard of it first in",The War of the Worlds_1
36,the issue of _Nature_ dated August 2. I am inclined to think that this,The War of the Worlds_1
36,"blaze may have been the casting of the huge gun, in the vast pit sunk",The War of the Worlds_1
36,"into their planet, from which their shots were fired at us. Peculiar",The War of the Worlds_1
36,"markings, as yet unexplained, were seen near the site of that outbreak",The War of the Worlds_1
36,during the next two oppositions.,The War of the Worlds_1
36,,The War of the Worlds_1
36,The storm burst upon us six years ago now. As Mars approached,The War of the Worlds_1
36,"opposition, Lavelle of Java set the wires of the astronomical exchange",The War of the Worlds_1
36,palpitating with the amazing intelligence of a huge outbreak of,The War of the Worlds_1
36,incandescent gas upon the planet. It had occurred towards midnight of,The War of the Worlds_1
36,"the twelfth; and the spectroscope, to which he had at once resorted,",The War of the Worlds_1
36,"indicated a mass of flaming gas, chiefly hydrogen, moving with an",The War of the Worlds_1
36,enormous velocity towards this earth. This jet of fire had become,The War of the Worlds_1
36,invisible about a quarter past twelve. He compared it to a colossal,The War of the Worlds_1
36,"puff of flame suddenly and violently squirted out of the planet, “as",The War of the Worlds_1
36,flaming gases rushed out of a gun.”,The War of the Worlds_1
36,,The War of the Worlds_1
36,A singularly appropriate phrase it proved. Yet the next day there was,The War of the Worlds_1
36,nothing of this in the papers except a little note in the _Daily,The War of the Worlds_1
36,"Telegraph_, and the world went in ignorance of one of the gravest",The War of the Worlds_1
36,dangers that ever threatened the human race. I might not have heard of,The War of the Worlds_1
36,"the eruption at all had I not met Ogilvy, the well-known astronomer, at",The War of the Worlds_1
36,"Ottershaw. He was immensely excited at the news, and in the excess of",The War of the Worlds_1
36,his feelings invited me up to take a turn with him that night in a,The War of the Worlds_1
36,scrutiny of the red planet.,The War of the Worlds_1
36,,The War of the Worlds_1
36,"In spite of all that has happened since, I still remember that vigil",The War of the Worlds_1
36,"very distinctly: the black and silent observatory, the shadowed lantern",The War of the Worlds_1
36,"throwing a feeble glow upon the floor in the corner, the steady ticking",The War of the Worlds_1
36,"of the clockwork of the telescope, the little slit in the roof—an",The War of the Worlds_1
36,oblong profundity with the stardust streaked across it. Ogilvy moved,The War of the Worlds_1
36,"about, invisible but audible. Looking through the telescope, one saw a",The War of the Worlds_1
36,circle of deep blue and the little round planet swimming in the field.,The War of the Worlds_1
36,"It seemed such a little thing, so bright and small and still, faintly",The War of the Worlds_1
36,"marked with transverse stripes, and slightly flattened from the perfect",The War of the Worlds_1
36,"round. But so little it was, so silvery warm—a pin’s head of light! It",The War of the Worlds_1
36,"was as if it quivered, but really this was the telescope vibrating with",The War of the Worlds_1
36,the activity of the clockwork that kept the planet in view.,The War of the Worlds_1
36,,The War of the Worlds_1
36,"As I watched, the planet seemed to grow larger and smaller and to",The War of the Worlds_1
36,"advance and recede, but that was simply that my eye was tired. Forty",The War of the Worlds_1
36,millions of miles it was from us—more than forty millions of miles of,The War of the Worlds_1
36,void. Few people realise the immensity of vacancy in which the dust of,The War of the Worlds_1
36,the material universe swims.,The War of the Worlds_1
36,,The War of the Worlds_1
36,"Near it in the field, I remember, were three faint points of light,",The War of the Worlds_1
36,"three telescopic stars infinitely remote, and all around it was the",The War of the Worlds_1
36,unfathomable darkness of empty space. You know how that blackness looks,The War of the Worlds_1
36,on a frosty starlight night. In a telescope it seems far profounder.,The War of the Worlds_1
36,"And invisible to me because it was so remote and small, flying swiftly",The War of the Worlds_1
36,"and steadily towards me across that incredible distance, drawing nearer",The War of the Worlds_1
36,"every minute by so many thousands of miles, came the Thing they were",The War of the Worlds_1
36,"sending us, the Thing that was to bring so much struggle and calamity",The War of the Worlds_1
36,and death to the earth. I never dreamed of it then as I watched; no one,The War of the Worlds_1
36,on earth dreamed of that unerring missile.,The War of the Worlds_1
36,,The War of the Worlds_1
36,"That night, too, there was another jetting out of gas from the distant",The War of the Worlds_1
36,"planet. I saw it. A reddish flash at the edge, the slightest projection",The War of the Worlds_1
36,of the outline just as the chronometer struck midnight; and at that I,The War of the Worlds_1
36,"told Ogilvy and he took my place. The night was warm and I was thirsty,",The War of the Worlds_1
36,and I went stretching my legs clumsily and feeling my way in the,The War of the Worlds_1
36,"darkness, to the little table where the siphon stood, while Ogilvy",The War of the Worlds_1
36,exclaimed at the streamer of gas that came out towards us.,The War of the Worlds_1
36,,The War of the Worlds_1
36,That night another invisible missile started on its way to the earth,The War of the Worlds_1
36,"from Mars, just a second or so under twenty-four hours after the first",The War of the Worlds_1
36,"one. I remember how I sat on the table there in the blackness, with",The War of the Worlds_1
36,patches of green and crimson swimming before my eyes. I wished I had a,The War of the Worlds_1
36,"light to smoke by, little suspecting the meaning of the minute gleam I",The War of the Worlds_1
36,had seen and all that it would presently bring me. Ogilvy watched till,The War of the Worlds_1
36,"one, and then gave it up; and we lit the lantern and walked over to his",The War of the Worlds_1
36,house. Down below in the darkness were Ottershaw and Chertsey and all,The War of the Worlds_1
36,"their hundreds of people, sleeping in peace.",The War of the Worlds_1
36,,The War of the Worlds_1
36,"He was full of speculation that night about the condition of Mars, and",The War of the Worlds_1
36,scoffed at the vulgar idea of its having inhabitants who were,The War of the Worlds_1
36,signalling us. His idea was that meteorites might be falling in a heavy,The War of the Worlds_1
36,"shower upon the planet, or that a huge volcanic explosion was in",The War of the Worlds_1
36,progress. He pointed out to me how unlikely it was that organic,The War of the Worlds_1
36,evolution had taken the same direction in the two adjacent planets.,The War of the Worlds_1
36,,The War of the Worlds_1
36,"“The chances against anything manlike on Mars are a million to one,” he",The War of the Worlds_1
36,said.,The War of the Worlds_1
36,,The War of the Worlds_1
36,Hundreds of observers saw the flame that night and the night after,The War of the Worlds_1
36,"about midnight, and again the night after; and so for ten nights, a",The War of the Worlds_1
36,flame each night. Why the shots ceased after the tenth no one on earth,The War of the Worlds_1
36,has attempted to explain. It may be the gases of the firing caused the,The War of the Worlds_1
36,"Martians inconvenience. Dense clouds of smoke or dust, visible through",The War of the Worlds_1
36,"a powerful telescope on earth as little grey, fluctuating patches,",The War of the Worlds_1
36,spread through the clearness of the planet’s atmosphere and obscured,The War of the Worlds_1
36,its more familiar features.,The War of the Worlds_1
36,,The War of the Worlds_1
36,"Even the daily papers woke up to the disturbances at last, and popular",The War of the Worlds_1
36,"notes appeared here, there, and everywhere concerning the volcanoes",The War of the Worlds_1
36,"upon Mars. The seriocomic periodical _Punch_, I remember, made a happy",The War of the Worlds_1
36,"use of it in the political cartoon. And, all unsuspected, those",The War of the Worlds_1
36,"missiles the Martians had fired at us drew earthward, rushing now at a",The War of the Worlds_1
36,"pace of many miles a second through the empty gulf of space, hour by",The War of the Worlds_1
36,"hour and day by day, nearer and nearer. It seems to me now almost",The War of the Worlds_1
36,"incredibly wonderful that, with that swift fate hanging over us, men",The War of the Worlds_1
36,could go about their petty concerns as they did. I remember how,The War of the Worlds_1
36,jubilant Markham was at securing a new photograph of the planet for the,The War of the Worlds_1
36,illustrated paper he edited in those days. People in these latter times,The War of the Worlds_1
36,scarcely realise the abundance and enterprise of our nineteenth-century,The War of the Worlds_1
36,"papers. For my own part, I was much occupied in learning to ride the",The War of the Worlds_1
36,"bicycle, and busy upon a series of papers discussing the probable",The War of the Worlds_1
36,developments of moral ideas as civilisation progressed.,The War of the Worlds_1
36,,The War of the Worlds_1
36,"One night (the first missile then could scarcely have been 10,000,000",The War of the Worlds_1
36,miles away) I went for a walk with my wife. It was starlight and I,The War of the Worlds_1
36,"explained the Signs of the Zodiac to her, and pointed out Mars, a",The War of the Worlds_1
36,"bright dot of light creeping zenithward, towards which so many",The War of the Worlds_1
36,"telescopes were pointed. It was a warm night. Coming home, a party of",The War of the Worlds_1
36,excursionists from Chertsey or Isleworth passed us singing and playing,The War of the Worlds_1
36,music. There were lights in the upper windows of the houses as the,The War of the Worlds_1
36,people went to bed. From the railway station in the distance came the,The War of the Worlds_1
36,"sound of shunting trains, ringing and rumbling, softened almost into",The War of the Worlds_1
36,melody by the distance. My wife pointed out to me the brightness of the,The War of the Worlds_1
36,"red, green, and yellow signal lights hanging in a framework against the",The War of the Worlds_1
36,sky. It seemed so safe and tranquil.,The War of the Worlds_1
36,,The War of the Worlds_1
36,,The War of the Worlds_1
36,,The War of the Worlds_1
36,,The War of the Worlds_1
36,II.,The War of the Worlds_2
36,THE FALLING STAR.,The War of the Worlds_2
36,,The War of the Worlds_2
36,,The War of the Worlds_2
36,Then came the night of the first falling star. It was seen early in the,The War of the Worlds_2
36,"morning, rushing over Winchester eastward, a line of flame high in the",The War of the Worlds_2
36,"atmosphere. Hundreds must have seen it, and taken it for an ordinary",The War of the Worlds_2
36,falling star. Albin described it as leaving a greenish streak behind it,The War of the Worlds_2
36,"that glowed for some seconds. Denning, our greatest authority on",The War of the Worlds_2
36,"meteorites, stated that the height of its first appearance was about",The War of the Worlds_2
36,ninety or one hundred miles. It seemed to him that it fell to earth,The War of the Worlds_2
36,about one hundred miles east of him.,The War of the Worlds_2
36,,The War of the Worlds_2
36,I was at home at that hour and writing in my study; and although my,The War of the Worlds_2
36,French windows face towards Ottershaw and the blind was up (for I loved,The War of the Worlds_2
36,"in those days to look up at the night sky), I saw nothing of it. Yet",The War of the Worlds_2
36,this strangest of all things that ever came to earth from outer space,The War of the Worlds_2
36,"must have fallen while I was sitting there, visible to me had I only",The War of the Worlds_2
36,looked up as it passed. Some of those who saw its flight say it,The War of the Worlds_2
36,travelled with a hissing sound. I myself heard nothing of that. Many,The War of the Worlds_2
36,"people in Berkshire, Surrey, and Middlesex must have seen the fall of",The War of the Worlds_2
36,"it, and, at most, have thought that another meteorite had descended. No",The War of the Worlds_2
36,one seems to have troubled to look for the fallen mass that night.,The War of the Worlds_2
36,,The War of the Worlds_2
36,"But very early in the morning poor Ogilvy, who had seen the shooting",The War of the Worlds_2
36,star and who was persuaded that a meteorite lay somewhere on the common,The War of the Worlds_2
36,"between Horsell, Ottershaw, and Woking, rose early with the idea of",The War of the Worlds_2
36,"finding it. Find it he did, soon after dawn, and not far from the",The War of the Worlds_2
36,sand-pits. An enormous hole had been made by the impact of the,The War of the Worlds_2
36,"projectile, and the sand and gravel had been flung violently in every",The War of the Worlds_2
36,"direction over the heath, forming heaps visible a mile and a half away.",The War of the Worlds_2
36,"The heather was on fire eastward, and a thin blue smoke rose against",The War of the Worlds_2
36,the dawn.,The War of the Worlds_2
36,,The War of the Worlds_2
36,"The Thing itself lay almost entirely buried in sand, amidst the",The War of the Worlds_2
36,scattered splinters of a fir tree it had shivered to fragments in its,The War of the Worlds_2
36,"descent. The uncovered part had the appearance of a huge cylinder,",The War of the Worlds_2
36,caked over and its outline softened by a thick scaly dun-coloured,The War of the Worlds_2
36,incrustation. It had a diameter of about thirty yards. He approached,The War of the Worlds_2
36,"the mass, surprised at the size and more so at the shape, since most",The War of the Worlds_2
36,"meteorites are rounded more or less completely. It was, however, still",The War of the Worlds_2
36,so hot from its flight through the air as to forbid his near approach.,The War of the Worlds_2
36,A stirring noise within its cylinder he ascribed to the unequal cooling,The War of the Worlds_2
36,of its surface; for at that time it had not occurred to him that it,The War of the Worlds_2
36,might be hollow.,The War of the Worlds_2
36,,The War of the Worlds_2
36,He remained standing at the edge of the pit that the Thing had made for,The War of the Worlds_2
36,"itself, staring at its strange appearance, astonished chiefly at its",The War of the Worlds_2
36,"unusual shape and colour, and dimly perceiving even then some evidence",The War of the Worlds_2
36,"of design in its arrival. The early morning was wonderfully still, and",The War of the Worlds_2
36,"the sun, just clearing the pine trees towards Weybridge, was already",The War of the Worlds_2
36,"warm. He did not remember hearing any birds that morning, there was",The War of the Worlds_2
36,"certainly no breeze stirring, and the only sounds were the faint",The War of the Worlds_2
36,movements from within the cindery cylinder. He was all alone on the,The War of the Worlds_2
36,common.,The War of the Worlds_2
36,,The War of the Worlds_2
36,"Then suddenly he noticed with a start that some of the grey clinker,",The War of the Worlds_2
36,"the ashy incrustation that covered the meteorite, was falling off the",The War of the Worlds_2
36,circular edge of the end. It was dropping off in flakes and raining,The War of the Worlds_2
36,down upon the sand. A large piece suddenly came off and fell with a,The War of the Worlds_2
36,sharp noise that brought his heart into his mouth.,The War of the Worlds_2
36,,The War of the Worlds_2
36,"For a minute he scarcely realised what this meant, and, although the",The War of the Worlds_2
36,"heat was excessive, he clambered down into the pit close to the bulk to",The War of the Worlds_2
36,see the Thing more clearly. He fancied even then that the cooling of,The War of the Worlds_2
36,"the body might account for this, but what disturbed that idea was the",The War of the Worlds_2
36,fact that the ash was falling only from the end of the cylinder.,The War of the Worlds_2
36,,The War of the Worlds_2
36,"And then he perceived that, very slowly, the circular top of the",The War of the Worlds_2
36,cylinder was rotating on its body. It was such a gradual movement that,The War of the Worlds_2
36,he discovered it only through noticing that a black mark that had been,The War of the Worlds_2
36,near him five minutes ago was now at the other side of the,The War of the Worlds_2
36,"circumference. Even then he scarcely understood what this indicated,",The War of the Worlds_2
36,until he heard a muffled grating sound and saw the black mark jerk,The War of the Worlds_2
36,forward an inch or so. Then the thing came upon him in a flash. The,The War of the Worlds_2
36,cylinder was artificial—hollow—with an end that screwed out! Something,The War of the Worlds_2
36,within the cylinder was unscrewing the top!,The War of the Worlds_2
36,,The War of the Worlds_2
36,“Good heavens!” said Ogilvy. “There’s a man in it—men in it! Half,The War of the Worlds_2
36,roasted to death! Trying to escape!”,The War of the Worlds_2
36,,The War of the Worlds_2
36,"At once, with a quick mental leap, he linked the Thing with the flash",The War of the Worlds_2
36,upon Mars.,The War of the Worlds_2
36,,The War of the Worlds_2
36,The thought of the confined creature was so dreadful to him that he,The War of the Worlds_2
36,forgot the heat and went forward to the cylinder to help turn. But,The War of the Worlds_2
36,luckily the dull radiation arrested him before he could burn his hands,The War of the Worlds_2
36,"on the still-glowing metal. At that he stood irresolute for a moment,",The War of the Worlds_2
36,"then turned, scrambled out of the pit, and set off running wildly into",The War of the Worlds_2
36,Woking. The time then must have been somewhere about six o’clock. He,The War of the Worlds_2
36,"met a waggoner and tried to make him understand, but the tale he told",The War of the Worlds_2
36,and his appearance were so wild—his hat had fallen off in the pit—that,The War of the Worlds_2
36,the man simply drove on. He was equally unsuccessful with the potman,The War of the Worlds_2
36,who was just unlocking the doors of the public-house by Horsell Bridge.,The War of the Worlds_2
36,The fellow thought he was a lunatic at large and made an unsuccessful,The War of the Worlds_2
36,attempt to shut him into the taproom. That sobered him a little; and,The War of the Worlds_2
36,"when he saw Henderson, the London journalist, in his garden, he called",The War of the Worlds_2
36,over the palings and made himself understood.,The War of the Worlds_2
36,,The War of the Worlds_2
36,"“Henderson,” he called, “you saw that shooting star last night?”",The War of the Worlds_2
36,,The War of the Worlds_2
36,“Well?” said Henderson.,The War of the Worlds_2
36,,The War of the Worlds_2
36,“It’s out on Horsell Common now.”,The War of the Worlds_2
36,,The War of the Worlds_2
36,“Good Lord!” said Henderson. “Fallen meteorite! That’s good.”,The War of the Worlds_2
36,,The War of the Worlds_2
36,“But it’s something more than a meteorite. It’s a cylinder—an,The War of the Worlds_2
36,"artificial cylinder, man! And there’s something inside.”",The War of the Worlds_2
36,,The War of the Worlds_2
36,Henderson stood up with his spade in his hand.,The War of the Worlds_2
36,,The War of the Worlds_2
36,“What’s that?” he said. He was deaf in one ear.,The War of the Worlds_2
36,,The War of the Worlds_2
36,Ogilvy told him all that he had seen. Henderson was a minute or so,The War of the Worlds_2
36,"taking it in. Then he dropped his spade, snatched up his jacket, and",The War of the Worlds_2
36,"came out into the road. The two men hurried back at once to the common,",The War of the Worlds_2
36,and found the cylinder still lying in the same position. But now the,The War of the Worlds_2
36,"sounds inside had ceased, and a thin circle of bright metal showed",The War of the Worlds_2
36,between the top and the body of the cylinder. Air was either entering,The War of the Worlds_2
36,"or escaping at the rim with a thin, sizzling sound.",The War of the Worlds_2
36,,The War of the Worlds_2
36,"They listened, rapped on the scaly burnt metal with a stick, and,",The War of the Worlds_2
36,"meeting with no response, they both concluded the man or men inside",The War of the Worlds_2
36,must be insensible or dead.,The War of the Worlds_2
36,,The War of the Worlds_2
36,Of course the two were quite unable to do anything. They shouted,The War of the Worlds_2
36,"consolation and promises, and went off back to the town again to get",The War of the Worlds_2
36,"help. One can imagine them, covered with sand, excited and disordered,",The War of the Worlds_2
36,running up the little street in the bright sunlight just as the shop,The War of the Worlds_2
36,folks were taking down their shutters and people were opening their,The War of the Worlds_2
36,"bedroom windows. Henderson went into the railway station at once, in",The War of the Worlds_2
36,order to telegraph the news to London. The newspaper articles had,The War of the Worlds_2
36,prepared men’s minds for the reception of the idea.,The War of the Worlds_2
36,,The War of the Worlds_2
36,By eight o’clock a number of boys and unemployed men had already,The War of the Worlds_2
36,started for the common to see the “dead men from Mars.” That was the,The War of the Worlds_2
36,form the story took. I heard of it first from my newspaper boy about a,The War of the Worlds_2
36,quarter to nine when I went out to get my _Daily Chronicle_. I was,The War of the Worlds_2
36,"naturally startled, and lost no time in going out and across the",The War of the Worlds_2

36,III.,The War of the Worlds_3
36,ON HORSELL COMMON.,The War of the Worlds_3
36,,The War of the Worlds_3
36,,The War of the Worlds_3
36,I found a little crowd of perhaps twenty people surrounding the huge,The War of the Worlds_3
36,hole in which the cylinder lay. I have already described the appearance,The War of the Worlds_3
36,"of that colossal bulk, embedded in the ground. The turf and gravel",The War of the Worlds_3
36,about it seemed charred as if by a sudden explosion. No doubt its,The War of the Worlds_3
36,impact had caused a flash of fire. Henderson and Ogilvy were not there.,The War of the Worlds_3
36,"I think they perceived that nothing was to be done for the present, and",The War of the Worlds_3
36,had gone away to breakfast at Henderson’s house.,The War of the Worlds_3
36,,The War of the Worlds_3
36,"There were four or five boys sitting on the edge of the Pit, with their",The War of the Worlds_3
36,"feet dangling, and amusing themselves—until I stopped them—by throwing",The War of the Worlds_3
36,"stones at the giant mass. After I had spoken to them about it, they",The War of the Worlds_3
36,began playing at “touch” in and out of the group of bystanders.,The War of the Worlds_3
36,,The War of the Worlds_3
36,"Among these were a couple of cyclists, a jobbing gardener I employed",The War of the Worlds_3
36,"sometimes, a girl carrying a baby, Gregg the butcher and his little",The War of the Worlds_3
36,"boy, and two or three loafers and golf caddies who were accustomed to",The War of the Worlds_3
36,hang about the railway station. There was very little talking. Few of,The War of the Worlds_3
36,the common people in England had anything but the vaguest astronomical,The War of the Worlds_3
36,ideas in those days. Most of them were staring quietly at the big table,The War of the Worlds_3
36,"like end of the cylinder, which was still as Ogilvy and Henderson had",The War of the Worlds_3
36,left it. I fancy the popular expectation of a heap of charred corpses,The War of the Worlds_3
36,was disappointed at this inanimate bulk. Some went away while I was,The War of the Worlds_3
36,"there, and other people came. I clambered into the pit and fancied I",The War of the Worlds_3
36,heard a faint movement under my feet. The top had certainly ceased to,The War of the Worlds_3
36,rotate.,The War of the Worlds_3
36,,The War of the Worlds_3
36,It was only when I got thus close to it that the strangeness of this,The War of the Worlds_3
36,object was at all evident to me. At the first glance it was really no,The War of the Worlds_3
36,more exciting than an overturned carriage or a tree blown across the,The War of the Worlds_3
36,"road. Not so much so, indeed. It looked like a rusty gas float. It",The War of the Worlds_3
36,required a certain amount of scientific education to perceive that the,The War of the Worlds_3
36,"grey scale of the Thing was no common oxide, that the yellowish-white",The War of the Worlds_3
36,metal that gleamed in the crack between the lid and the cylinder had an,The War of the Worlds_3
36,unfamiliar hue. “Extra-terrestrial” had no meaning for most of the,The War of the Worlds_3
36,onlookers.,The War of the Worlds_3
36,,The War of the Worlds_3
36,At that time it was quite clear in my own mind that the Thing had come,The War of the Worlds_3
36,"from the planet Mars, but I judged it improbable that it contained any",The War of the Worlds_3
36,living creature. I thought the unscrewing might be automatic. In spite,The War of the Worlds_3
36,"of Ogilvy, I still believed that there were men in Mars. My mind ran",The War of the Worlds_3
36,"fancifully on the possibilities of its containing manuscript, on the",The War of the Worlds_3
36,"difficulties in translation that might arise, whether we should find",The War of the Worlds_3
36,"coins and models in it, and so forth. Yet it was a little too large for",The War of the Worlds_3
36,assurance on this idea. I felt an impatience to see it opened. About,The War of the Worlds_3
36,"eleven, as nothing seemed happening, I walked back, full of such",The War of the Worlds_3
36,"thought, to my home in Maybury. But I found it difficult to get to work",The War of the Worlds_3
36,upon my abstract investigations.,The War of the Worlds_3
36,,The War of the Worlds_3
36,In the afternoon the appearance of the common had altered very much.,The War of the Worlds_3
36,The early editions of the evening papers had startled London with,The War of the Worlds_3
36,enormous headlines:,The War of the Worlds_3

36,"“REMARKABLE STORY FROM WOKING,”",The War of the Worlds_3
36,,The War of the Worlds_3
36,,The War of the Worlds_3
36,"and so forth. In addition, Ogilvy’s wire to the Astronomical Exchange",The War of the Worlds_3
36,had roused every observatory in the three kingdoms.,The War of the Worlds_3
36,,The War of the Worlds_3
36,There were half a dozen flys or more from the Woking station standing,The War of the Worlds_3
36,"in the road by the sand-pits, a basket-chaise from Chobham, and a",The War of the Worlds_3
36,"rather lordly carriage. Besides that, there was quite a heap of",The War of the Worlds_3
36,"bicycles. In addition, a large number of people must have walked, in",The War of the Worlds_3
36,"spite of the heat of the day, from Woking and Chertsey, so that there",The War of the Worlds_3
36,was altogether quite a considerable crowd—one or two gaily dressed,The War of the Worlds_3
36,ladies among the others.,The War of the Worlds_3
36,,The War of the Worlds_3
36,"It was glaringly hot, not a cloud in the sky nor a breath of wind, and",The War of the Worlds_3
36,the only shadow was that of the few scattered pine trees. The burning,The War of the Worlds_3
36,"heather had been extinguished, but the level ground towards Ottershaw",The War of the Worlds_3
36,"was blackened as far as one could see, and still giving off vertical",The War of the Worlds_3
36,streamers of smoke. An enterprising sweet-stuff dealer in the Chobham,The War of the Worlds_3
36,Road had sent up his son with a barrow-load of green apples and ginger,The War of the Worlds_3
36,beer.,The War of the Worlds_3
36,,The War of the Worlds_3
36,"Going to the edge of the pit, I found it occupied by a group of about",The War of the Worlds_3
36,"half a dozen men—Henderson, Ogilvy, and a tall, fair-haired man that I",The War of the Worlds_3
36,"afterwards learned was Stent, the Astronomer Royal, with several",The War of the Worlds_3
36,workmen wielding spades and pickaxes. Stent was giving directions in a,The War of the Worlds_3
36,"clear, high-pitched voice. He was standing on the cylinder, which was",The War of the Worlds_3
36,now evidently much cooler; his face was crimson and streaming with,The War of the Worlds_3
36,"perspiration, and something seemed to have irritated him.",The War of the Worlds_3
36,,The War of the Worlds_3
36,"A large portion of the cylinder had been uncovered, though its lower",The War of the Worlds_3
36,end was still embedded. As soon as Ogilvy saw me among the staring,The War of the Worlds_3
36,"crowd on the edge of the pit he called to me to come down, and asked me",The War of the Worlds_3
36,"if I would mind going over to see Lord Hilton, the lord of the manor.",The War of the Worlds_3
36,,The War of the Worlds_3
36,"The growing crowd, he said, was becoming a serious impediment to their",The War of the Worlds_3
36,"excavations, especially the boys. They wanted a light railing put up,",The War of the Worlds_3
36,and help to keep the people back. He told me that a faint stirring was,The War of the Worlds_3
36,"occasionally still audible within the case, but that the workmen had",The War of the Worlds_3
36,"failed to unscrew the top, as it afforded no grip to them. The case",The War of the Worlds_3
36,"appeared to be enormously thick, and it was possible that the faint",The War of the Worlds_3
36,sounds we heard represented a noisy tumult in the interior.,The War of the Worlds_3
36,,The War of the Worlds_3
36,"I was very glad to do as he asked, and so become one of the privileged",The War of the Worlds_3
36,spectators within the contemplated enclosure. I failed to find Lord,The War of the Worlds_3
36,"Hilton at his house, but I was told he was expected from London by the",The War of the Worlds_3
36,six o’clock train from Waterloo; and as it was then about a quarter,The War of the Worlds_3
36,"past five, I went home, had some tea, and walked up to the station to",The War of the Worlds_3

36,When I returned to the common the sun was setting. Scattered groups,The War of the Worlds_4
36,"were hurrying from the direction of Woking, and one or two persons were",The War of the Worlds_4
36,"returning. The crowd about the pit had increased, and stood out black",The War of the Worlds_4
36,"against the lemon yellow of the sky—a couple of hundred people,",The War of the Worlds_4
36,"perhaps. There were raised voices, and some sort of struggle appeared",The War of the Worlds_4
36,to be going on about the pit. Strange imaginings passed through my,The War of the Worlds_4
36,mind. As I drew nearer I heard Stent’s voice:,The War of the Worlds_4
36,,The War of the Worlds_4
36,“Keep back! Keep back!”,The War of the Worlds_4
36,,The War of the Worlds_4
36,A boy came running towards me.,The War of the Worlds_4
36,,The War of the Worlds_4
36,"“It’s a-movin’,” he said to me as he passed; “a-screwin’ and a-screwin’",The War of the Worlds_4
36,"out. I don’t like it. I’m a-goin’ ’ome, I am.”",The War of the Worlds_4
36,,The War of the Worlds_4
36,"I went on to the crowd. There were really, I should think, two or three",The War of the Worlds_4
36,"hundred people elbowing and jostling one another, the one or two ladies",The War of the Worlds_4
36,there being by no means the least active.,The War of the Worlds_4
36,,The War of the Worlds_4
36,“He’s fallen in the pit!” cried some one.,The War of the Worlds_4
36,,The War of the Worlds_4
36,“Keep back!” said several.,The War of the Worlds_4
36,,The War of the Worlds_4
36,"The crowd swayed a little, and I elbowed my way through. Every one",The War of the Worlds_4
36,seemed greatly excited. I heard a peculiar humming sound from the pit.,The War of the Worlds_4
36,,The War of the Worlds_4
36,“I say!” said Ogilvy; “help keep these idiots back. We don’t know,The War of the Worlds_4
36,"what’s in the confounded thing, you know!”",The War of the Worlds_4
36,,The War of the Worlds_4
36,"I saw a young man, a shop assistant in Woking I believe he was,",The War of the Worlds_4
36,standing on the cylinder and trying to scramble out of the hole again.,The War of the Worlds_4
36,The crowd had pushed him in.,The War of the Worlds_4
36,,The War of the Worlds_4
36,The end of the cylinder was being screwed out from within. Nearly two,The War of the Worlds_4
36,"feet of shining screw projected. Somebody blundered against me, and I",The War of the Worlds_4
36,"narrowly missed being pitched onto the top of the screw. I turned, and",The War of the Worlds_4
36,"as I did so the screw must have come out, for the lid of the cylinder",The War of the Worlds_4
36,fell upon the gravel with a ringing concussion. I stuck my elbow into,The War of the Worlds_4
36,"the person behind me, and turned my head towards the Thing again. For a",The War of the Worlds_4
36,moment that circular cavity seemed perfectly black. I had the sunset in,The War of the Worlds_4
36,my eyes.,The War of the Worlds_4
36,,The War of the Worlds_4
36,I think everyone expected to see a man emerge—possibly something a,The War of the Worlds_4
36,"little unlike us terrestrial men, but in all essentials a man. I know I",The War of the Worlds_4
36,"did. But, looking, I presently saw something stirring within the",The War of the Worlds_4
36,"shadow: greyish billowy movements, one above another, and then two",The War of the Worlds_4
36,luminous disks—like eyes. Then something resembling a little grey,The War of the Worlds_4
36,"snake, about the thickness of a walking stick, coiled up out of the",The War of the Worlds_4
36,"writhing middle, and wriggled in the air towards me—and then another.",The War of the Worlds_4
36,,The War of the Worlds_4
36,A sudden chill came over me. There was a loud shriek from a woman,The War of the Worlds_4
36,"behind. I half turned, keeping my eyes fixed upon the cylinder still,",The War of the Worlds_4
36,"from which other tentacles were now projecting, and began pushing my",The War of the Worlds_4
36,way back from the edge of the pit. I saw astonishment giving place to,The War of the Worlds_4
36,horror on the faces of the people about me. I heard inarticulate,The War of the Worlds_4
36,exclamations on all sides. There was a general movement backwards. I,The War of the Worlds_4
36,saw the shopman struggling still on the edge of the pit. I found myself,The War of the Worlds_4
36,"alone, and saw the people on the other side of the pit running off,",The War of the Worlds_4
36,"Stent among them. I looked again at the cylinder, and ungovernable",The War of the Worlds_4
36,terror gripped me. I stood petrified and staring.,The War of the Worlds_4
36,,The War of the Worlds_4
36,"A big greyish rounded bulk, the size, perhaps, of a bear, was rising",The War of the Worlds_4
36,slowly and painfully out of the cylinder. As it bulged up and caught,The War of the Worlds_4
36,"the light, it glistened like wet leather.",The War of the Worlds_4
36,,The War of the Worlds_4
36,Two large dark-coloured eyes were regarding me steadfastly. The mass,The War of the Worlds_4
36,"that framed them, the head of the thing, was rounded, and had, one",The War of the Worlds_4
36,"might say, a face. There was a mouth under the eyes, the lipless brim",The War of the Worlds_4
36,"of which quivered and panted, and dropped saliva. The whole creature",The War of the Worlds_4
36,heaved and pulsated convulsively. A lank tentacular appendage gripped,The War of the Worlds_4
36,"the edge of the cylinder, another swayed in the air.",The War of the Worlds_4
36,,The War of the Worlds_4
36,Those who have never seen a living Martian can scarcely imagine the,The War of the Worlds_4
36,strange horror of its appearance. The peculiar V-shaped mouth with its,The War of the Worlds_4
36,"pointed upper lip, the absence of brow ridges, the absence of a chin",The War of the Worlds_4
36,"beneath the wedgelike lower lip, the incessant quivering of this mouth,",The War of the Worlds_4
36,"the Gorgon groups of tentacles, the tumultuous breathing of the lungs",The War of the Worlds_4
36,"in a strange atmosphere, the evident heaviness and painfulness of",The War of the Worlds_4
36,movement due to the greater gravitational energy of the earth—above,The War of the Worlds_4
36,"all, the extraordinary intensity of the immense eyes—were at once",The War of the Worlds_4
36,"vital, intense, inhuman, crippled and monstrous. There was something",The War of the Worlds_4
36,"fungoid in the oily brown skin, something in the clumsy deliberation of",The War of the Worlds_4
36,"the tedious movements unspeakably nasty. Even at this first encounter,",The War of the Worlds_4
36,"this first glimpse, I was overcome with disgust and dread.",The War of the Worlds_4
36,,The War of the Worlds_4
36,Suddenly the monster vanished. It had toppled over the brim of the,The War of the Worlds_4
36,"cylinder and fallen into the pit, with a thud like the fall of a great",The War of the Worlds_4
36,"mass of leather. I heard it give a peculiar thick cry, and forthwith",The War of the Worlds_4
36,another of these creatures appeared darkly in the deep shadow of the,The War of the Worlds_4
36,aperture.,The War of the Worlds_4
36,,The War of the Worlds_4
36,"I turned and, running madly, made for the first group of trees, perhaps",The War of the Worlds_4
36,"a hundred yards away; but I ran slantingly and stumbling, for I could",The War of the Worlds_4
36,not avert my face from these things.,The War of the Worlds_4
36,,The War of the Worlds_4
36,"There, among some young pine trees and furze bushes, I stopped,",The War of the Worlds_4
36,"panting, and waited further developments. The common round the",The War of the Worlds_4
36,"sand-pits was dotted with people, standing like myself in a",The War of the Worlds_4
36,"half-fascinated terror, staring at these creatures, or rather at the",The War of the Worlds_4
36,"heaped gravel at the edge of the pit in which they lay. And then, with",The War of the Worlds_4
36,"a renewed horror, I saw a round, black object bobbing up and down on",The War of the Worlds_4
36,"the edge of the pit. It was the head of the shopman who had fallen in,",The War of the Worlds_4
36,but showing as a little black object against the hot western sun. Now,The War of the Worlds_4
36,"he got his shoulder and knee up, and again he seemed to slip back until",The War of the Worlds_4
36,"only his head was visible. Suddenly he vanished, and I could have",The War of the Worlds_4
36,fancied a faint shriek had reached me. I had a momentary impulse to go,The War of the Worlds_4
36,back and help him that my fears overruled.,The War of the Worlds_4
36,,The War of the Worlds_4
36,"Everything was then quite invisible, hidden by the deep pit and the",The War of the Worlds_4
36,heap of sand that the fall of the cylinder had made. Anyone coming,The War of the Worlds_4
36,along the road from Chobham or Woking would have been amazed at the,The War of the Worlds_4
36,sight—a dwindling multitude of perhaps a hundred people or more,The War of the Worlds_4
36,"standing in a great irregular circle, in ditches, behind bushes, behind",The War of the Worlds_4
36,"gates and hedges, saying little to one another and that in short,",The War of the Worlds_4
36,"excited shouts, and staring, staring hard at a few heaps of sand. The",The War of the Worlds_4
36,"barrow of ginger beer stood, a queer derelict, black against the",The War of the Worlds_4
36,"burning sky, and in the sand-pits was a row of deserted vehicles with",The War of the Worlds_4

36,,The War of the Worlds_5
36,After the glimpse I had had of the Martians emerging from the cylinder,The War of the Worlds_5
36,"in which they had come to the earth from their planet, a kind of",The War of the Worlds_5
36,fascination paralysed my actions. I remained standing knee-deep in the,The War of the Worlds_5
36,"heather, staring at the mound that hid them. I was a battleground of",The War of the Worlds_5
36,fear and curiosity.,The War of the Worlds_5
36,,The War of the Worlds_5
36,"I did not dare to go back towards the pit, but I felt a passionate",The War of the Worlds_5
36,"longing to peer into it. I began walking, therefore, in a big curve,",The War of the Worlds_5
36,seeking some point of vantage and continually looking at the sand-heaps,The War of the Worlds_5
36,that hid these new-comers to our earth. Once a leash of thin black,The War of the Worlds_5
36,"whips, like the arms of an octopus, flashed across the sunset and was",The War of the Worlds_5
36,"immediately withdrawn, and afterwards a thin rod rose up, joint by",The War of the Worlds_5
36,"joint, bearing at its apex a circular disk that spun with a wobbling",The War of the Worlds_5
36,motion. What could be going on there?,The War of the Worlds_5
36,,The War of the Worlds_5
36,Most of the spectators had gathered in one or two groups—one a little,The War of the Worlds_5
36,"crowd towards Woking, the other a knot of people in the direction of",The War of the Worlds_5
36,Chobham. Evidently they shared my mental conflict. There were few near,The War of the Worlds_5
36,"me. One man I approached—he was, I perceived, a neighbour of mine,",The War of the Worlds_5
36,though I did not know his name—and accosted. But it was scarcely a time,The War of the Worlds_5
36,for articulate conversation.,The War of the Worlds_5
36,,The War of the Worlds_5
36,“What ugly _brutes_!” he said. “Good God! What ugly brutes!” He,The War of the Worlds_5
36,repeated this over and over again.,The War of the Worlds_5
36,,The War of the Worlds_5
36,“Did you see a man in the pit?” I said; but he made no answer to that.,The War of the Worlds_5
36,"We became silent, and stood watching for a time side by side, deriving,",The War of the Worlds_5
36,"I fancy, a certain comfort in one another’s company. Then I shifted my",The War of the Worlds_5
36,position to a little knoll that gave me the advantage of a yard or more,The War of the Worlds_5
36,of elevation and when I looked for him presently he was walking towards,The War of the Worlds_5
36,Woking.,The War of the Worlds_5
36,,The War of the Worlds_5
36,The sunset faded to twilight before anything further happened. The,The War of the Worlds_5
36,"crowd far away on the left, towards Woking, seemed to grow, and I heard",The War of the Worlds_5
36,now a faint murmur from it. The little knot of people towards Chobham,The War of the Worlds_5
36,dispersed. There was scarcely an intimation of movement from the pit.,The War of the Worlds_5
36,,The War of the Worlds_5
36,"It was this, as much as anything, that gave people courage, and I",The War of the Worlds_5
36,suppose the new arrivals from Woking also helped to restore confidence.,The War of the Worlds_5
36,"At any rate, as the dusk came on a slow, intermittent movement upon the",The War of the Worlds_5
36,"sand-pits began, a movement that seemed to gather force as the",The War of the Worlds_5
36,stillness of the evening about the cylinder remained unbroken. Vertical,The War of the Worlds_5
36,"black figures in twos and threes would advance, stop, watch, and",The War of the Worlds_5
36,"advance again, spreading out as they did so in a thin irregular",The War of the Worlds_5
36,"crescent that promised to enclose the pit in its attenuated horns. I,",The War of the Worlds_5
36,"too, on my side began to move towards the pit.",The War of the Worlds_5
36,,The War of the Worlds_5
36,"Then I saw some cabmen and others had walked boldly into the sand-pits,",The War of the Worlds_5
36,and heard the clatter of hoofs and the gride of wheels. I saw a lad,The War of the Worlds_5
36,"trundling off the barrow of apples. And then, within thirty yards of",The War of the Worlds_5
36,"the pit, advancing from the direction of Horsell, I noted a little",The War of the Worlds_5
36,"black knot of men, the foremost of whom was waving a white flag.",The War of the Worlds_5
36,,The War of the Worlds_5
36,"This was the Deputation. There had been a hasty consultation, and since",The War of the Worlds_5
36,"the Martians were evidently, in spite of their repulsive forms,",The War of the Worlds_5
36,"intelligent creatures, it had been resolved to show them, by",The War of the Worlds_5
36,"approaching them with signals, that we too were intelligent.",The War of the Worlds_5
36,,The War of the Worlds_5
36,"Flutter, flutter, went the flag, first to the right, then to the left.",The War of the Worlds_5
36,"It was too far for me to recognise anyone there, but afterwards I",The War of the Worlds_5
36,"learned that Ogilvy, Stent, and Henderson were with others in this",The War of the Worlds_5
36,attempt at communication. This little group had in its advance dragged,The War of the Worlds_5
36,"inward, so to speak, the circumference of the now almost complete",The War of the Worlds_5
36,"circle of people, and a number of dim black figures followed it at",The War of the Worlds_5
36,discreet distances.,The War of the Worlds_5
36,,The War of the Worlds_5
36,"Suddenly there was a flash of light, and a quantity of luminous",The War of the Worlds_5
36,"greenish smoke came out of the pit in three distinct puffs, which drove",The War of the Worlds_5
36,"up, one after the other, straight into the still air.",The War of the Worlds_5
36,,The War of the Worlds_5
36,"This smoke (or flame, perhaps, would be the better word for it) was so",The War of the Worlds_5
36,bright that the deep blue sky overhead and the hazy stretches of brown,The War of the Worlds_5
36,"common towards Chertsey, set with black pine trees, seemed to darken",The War of the Worlds_5
36,"abruptly as these puffs arose, and to remain the darker after their",The War of the Worlds_5
36,dispersal. At the same time a faint hissing sound became audible.,The War of the Worlds_5
36,,The War of the Worlds_5
36,Beyond the pit stood the little wedge of people with the white flag at,The War of the Worlds_5
36,"its apex, arrested by these phenomena, a little knot of small vertical",The War of the Worlds_5
36,"black shapes upon the black ground. As the green smoke arose, their",The War of the Worlds_5
36,"faces flashed out pallid green, and faded again as it vanished. Then",The War of the Worlds_5
36,"slowly the hissing passed into a humming, into a long, loud, droning",The War of the Worlds_5
36,"noise. Slowly a humped shape rose out of the pit, and the ghost of a",The War of the Worlds_5
36,beam of light seemed to flicker out from it.,The War of the Worlds_5
36,,The War of the Worlds_5
36,"Forthwith flashes of actual flame, a bright glare leaping from one to",The War of the Worlds_5
36,"another, sprang from the scattered group of men. It was as if some",The War of the Worlds_5
36,invisible jet impinged upon them and flashed into white flame. It was,The War of the Worlds_5
36,as if each man were suddenly and momentarily turned to fire.,The War of the Worlds_5
36,,The War of the Worlds_5
36,"Then, by the light of their own destruction, I saw them staggering and",The War of the Worlds_5
36,"falling, and their supporters turning to run.",The War of the Worlds_5
36,,The War of the Worlds_5
36,"I stood staring, not as yet realising that this was death leaping from",The War of the Worlds_5
36,man to man in that little distant crowd. All I felt was that it was,The War of the Worlds_5
36,something very strange. An almost noiseless and blinding flash of,The War of the Worlds_5
36,"light, and a man fell headlong and lay still; and as the unseen shaft",The War of the Worlds_5
36,"of heat passed over them, pine trees burst into fire, and every dry",The War of the Worlds_5
36,furze bush became with one dull thud a mass of flames. And far away,The War of the Worlds_5
36,towards Knaphill I saw the flashes of trees and hedges and wooden,The War of the Worlds_5
36,buildings suddenly set alight.,The War of the Worlds_5
36,,The War of the Worlds_5
36,"It was sweeping round swiftly and steadily, this flaming death, this",The War of the Worlds_5
36,"invisible, inevitable sword of heat. I perceived it coming towards me",The War of the Worlds_5
36,"by the flashing bushes it touched, and was too astounded and stupefied",The War of the Worlds_5
36,to stir. I heard the crackle of fire in the sand-pits and the sudden,The War of the Worlds_5
36,squeal of a horse that was as suddenly stilled. Then it was as if an,The War of the Worlds_5
36,invisible yet intensely heated finger were drawn through the heather,The War of the Worlds_5
36,"between me and the Martians, and all along a curving line beyond the",The War of the Worlds_5
36,sand-pits the dark ground smoked and crackled. Something fell with a,The War of the Worlds_5
36,crash far away to the left where the road from Woking station opens out,The War of the Worlds_5
36,"on the common. Forth-with the hissing and humming ceased, and the",The War of the Worlds_5
36,"black, dome-like object sank slowly out of sight into the pit.",The War of the Worlds_5
36,,The War of the Worlds_5
36,"All this had happened with such swiftness that I had stood motionless,",The War of the Worlds_5
36,dumbfounded and dazzled by the flashes of light. Had that death swept,The War of the Worlds_5
36,"through a full circle, it must inevitably have slain me in my surprise.",The War of the Worlds_5
36,"But it passed and spared me, and left the night about me suddenly dark",The War of the Worlds_5
36,and unfamiliar.,The War of the Worlds_5
36,,The War of the Worlds_5
36,"The undulating common seemed now dark almost to blackness, except where",The War of the Worlds_5
36,its roadways lay grey and pale under the deep blue sky of the early,The War of the Worlds_5
36,"night. It was dark, and suddenly void of men. Overhead the stars were",The War of the Worlds_5
36,"mustering, and in the west the sky was still a pale, bright, almost",The War of the Worlds_5
36,greenish blue. The tops of the pine trees and the roofs of Horsell came,The War of the Worlds_5
36,out sharp and black against the western afterglow. The Martians and,The War of the Worlds_5
36,"their appliances were altogether invisible, save for that thin mast",The War of the Worlds_5
36,upon which their restless mirror wobbled. Patches of bush and isolated,The War of the Worlds_5
36,"trees here and there smoked and glowed still, and the houses towards",The War of the Worlds_5
36,Woking station were sending up spires of flame into the stillness of,The War of the Worlds_5
36,the evening air.,The War of the Worlds_5
36,,The War of the Worlds_5
36,Nothing was changed save for that and a terrible astonishment. The,The War of the Worlds_5
36,little group of black specks with the flag of white had been swept out,The War of the Worlds_5
36,"of existence, and the stillness of the evening, so it seemed to me, had",The War of the Worlds_5
36,scarcely been broken.,The War of the Worlds_5
36,,The War of the Worlds_5
36,"It came to me that I was upon this dark common, helpless, unprotected,",The War of the Worlds_5
36,"and alone. Suddenly, like a thing falling upon me from without,",The War of the Worlds_5
36,came—fear.,The War of the Worlds_5
36,,The War of the Worlds_5
36,With an effort I turned and began a stumbling run through the heather.,The War of the Worlds_5
36,,The War of the Worlds_5
36,"The fear I felt was no rational fear, but a panic terror not only of",The War of the Worlds_5
36,"the Martians, but of the dusk and stillness all about me. Such an",The War of the Worlds_5
36,extraordinary effect in unmanning me it had that I ran weeping silently,The War of the Worlds_5
36,"as a child might do. Once I had turned, I did not dare to look back.",The War of the Worlds_5
36,,The War of the Worlds_5
36,I remember I felt an extraordinary persuasion that I was being played,The War of the Worlds_5
36,"with, that presently, when I was upon the very verge of safety, this",The War of the Worlds_5
36,mysterious death—as swift as the passage of light—would leap after me,The War of the Worlds_5

36,THE HEAT-RAY IN THE CHOBHAM ROAD.,The War of the Worlds_6
36,,The War of the Worlds_6
36,,The War of the Worlds_6
36,It is still a matter of wonder how the Martians are able to slay men so,The War of the Worlds_6
36,swiftly and so silently. Many think that in some way they are able to,The War of the Worlds_6
36,generate an intense heat in a chamber of practically absolute,The War of the Worlds_6
36,non-conductivity. This intense heat they project in a parallel beam,The War of the Worlds_6
36,"against any object they choose, by means of a polished parabolic mirror",The War of the Worlds_6
36,"of unknown composition, much as the parabolic mirror of a lighthouse",The War of the Worlds_6
36,projects a beam of light. But no one has absolutely proved these,The War of the Worlds_6
36,"details. However it is done, it is certain that a beam of heat is the",The War of the Worlds_6
36,"essence of the matter. Heat, and invisible, instead of visible, light.",The War of the Worlds_6
36,"Whatever is combustible flashes into flame at its touch, lead runs like",The War of the Worlds_6
36,"water, it softens iron, cracks and melts glass, and when it falls upon",The War of the Worlds_6
36,"water, incontinently that explodes into steam.",The War of the Worlds_6
36,,The War of the Worlds_6
36,"That night nearly forty people lay under the starlight about the pit,",The War of the Worlds_6
36,"charred and distorted beyond recognition, and all night long the common",The War of the Worlds_6
36,from Horsell to Maybury was deserted and brightly ablaze.,The War of the Worlds_6
36,,The War of the Worlds_6
36,"The news of the massacre probably reached Chobham, Woking, and",The War of the Worlds_6
36,Ottershaw about the same time. In Woking the shops had closed when the,The War of the Worlds_6
36,"tragedy happened, and a number of people, shop people and so forth,",The War of the Worlds_6
36,"attracted by the stories they had heard, were walking over the Horsell",The War of the Worlds_6
36,Bridge and along the road between the hedges that runs out at last upon,The War of the Worlds_6
36,the common. You may imagine the young people brushed up after the,The War of the Worlds_6
36,"labours of the day, and making this novelty, as they would make any",The War of the Worlds_6
36,"novelty, the excuse for walking together and enjoying a trivial",The War of the Worlds_6
36,flirtation. You may figure to yourself the hum of voices along the road,The War of the Worlds_6
36,in the gloaming. . . .,The War of the Worlds_6
36,,The War of the Worlds_6
36,"As yet, of course, few people in Woking even knew that the cylinder had",The War of the Worlds_6
36,"opened, though poor Henderson had sent a messenger on a bicycle to the",The War of the Worlds_6
36,post office with a special wire to an evening paper.,The War of the Worlds_6
36,,The War of the Worlds_6
36,"As these folks came out by twos and threes upon the open, they found",The War of the Worlds_6
36,little knots of people talking excitedly and peering at the spinning,The War of the Worlds_6
36,"mirror over the sand-pits, and the newcomers were, no doubt, soon",The War of the Worlds_6
36,infected by the excitement of the occasion.,The War of the Worlds_6
36,,The War of the Worlds_6
36,"By half past eight, when the Deputation was destroyed, there may have",The War of the Worlds_6
36,"been a crowd of three hundred people or more at this place, besides",The War of the Worlds_6
36,those who had left the road to approach the Martians nearer. There were,The War of the Worlds_6
36,"three policemen too, one of whom was mounted, doing their best, under",The War of the Worlds_6
36,"instructions from Stent, to keep the people back and deter them from",The War of the Worlds_6
36,approaching the cylinder. There was some booing from those more,The War of the Worlds_6
36,thoughtless and excitable souls to whom a crowd is always an occasion,The War of the Worlds_6
36,for noise and horse-play.,The War of the Worlds_6
36,,The War of the Worlds_6
36,"Stent and Ogilvy, anticipating some possibilities of a collision, had",The War of the Worlds_6
36,telegraphed from Horsell to the barracks as soon as the Martians,The War of the Worlds_6
36,"emerged, for the help of a company of soldiers to protect these strange",The War of the Worlds_6
36,creatures from violence. After that they returned to lead that,The War of the Worlds_6
36,"ill-fated advance. The description of their death, as it was seen by",The War of the Worlds_6
36,"the crowd, tallies very closely with my own impressions: the three",The War of the Worlds_6
36,"puffs of green smoke, the deep humming note, and the flashes of flame.",The War of the Worlds_6
36,,The War of the Worlds_6
36,But that crowd of people had a far narrower escape than mine. Only the,The War of the Worlds_6
36,fact that a hummock of heathery sand intercepted the lower part of the,The War of the Worlds_6
36,Heat-Ray saved them. Had the elevation of the parabolic mirror been a,The War of the Worlds_6
36,"few yards higher, none could have lived to tell the tale. They saw the",The War of the Worlds_6
36,"flashes and the men falling and an invisible hand, as it were, lit the",The War of the Worlds_6
36,"bushes as it hurried towards them through the twilight. Then, with a",The War of the Worlds_6
36,"whistling note that rose above the droning of the pit, the beam swung",The War of the Worlds_6
36,"close over their heads, lighting the tops of the beech trees that line",The War of the Worlds_6
36,"the road, and splitting the bricks, smashing the windows, firing the",The War of the Worlds_6
36,"window frames, and bringing down in crumbling ruin a portion of the",The War of the Worlds_6
36,gable of the house nearest the corner.,The War of the Worlds_6
36,,The War of the Worlds_6
36,"In the sudden thud, hiss, and glare of the igniting trees, the",The War of the Worlds_6
36,panic-stricken crowd seems to have swayed hesitatingly for some,The War of the Worlds_6
36,"moments. Sparks and burning twigs began to fall into the road, and",The War of the Worlds_6
36,single leaves like puffs of flame. Hats and dresses caught fire. Then,The War of the Worlds_6
36,"came a crying from the common. There were shrieks and shouts, and",The War of the Worlds_6
36,suddenly a mounted policeman came galloping through the confusion with,The War of the Worlds_6
36,"his hands clasped over his head, screaming.",The War of the Worlds_6
36,,The War of the Worlds_6
36,"“They’re coming!” a woman shrieked, and incontinently everyone was",The War of the Worlds_6
36,"turning and pushing at those behind, in order to clear their way to",The War of the Worlds_6
36,Woking again. They must have bolted as blindly as a flock of sheep.,The War of the Worlds_6
36,Where the road grows narrow and black between the high banks the crowd,The War of the Worlds_6
36,"jammed, and a desperate struggle occurred. All that crowd did not",The War of the Worlds_6
36,"escape; three persons at least, two women and a little boy, were",The War of the Worlds_6
36,"crushed and trampled there, and left to die amid the terror and the",The War of the Worlds_6
36,darkness.,The War of the Worlds_6

36,HOW I REACHED HOME.,The War of the Worlds_7
36,,The War of the Worlds_7
36,,The War of the Worlds_7
36,"For my own part, I remember nothing of my flight except the stress of",The War of the Worlds_7
36,blundering against trees and stumbling through the heather. All about,The War of the Worlds_7
36,me gathered the invisible terrors of the Martians; that pitiless sword,The War of the Worlds_7
36,"of heat seemed whirling to and fro, flourishing overhead before it",The War of the Worlds_7
36,descended and smote me out of life. I came into the road between the,The War of the Worlds_7
36,"crossroads and Horsell, and ran along this to the crossroads.",The War of the Worlds_7
36,,The War of the Worlds_7
36,At last I could go no further; I was exhausted with the violence of my,The War of the Worlds_7
36,"emotion and of my flight, and I staggered and fell by the wayside. That",The War of the Worlds_7
36,was near the bridge that crosses the canal by the gasworks. I fell and,The War of the Worlds_7
36,lay still.,The War of the Worlds_7
36,,The War of the Worlds_7
36,I must have remained there some time.,The War of the Worlds_7
36,,The War of the Worlds_7
36,"I sat up, strangely perplexed. For a moment, perhaps, I could not",The War of the Worlds_7
36,clearly understand how I came there. My terror had fallen from me like,The War of the Worlds_7
36,"a garment. My hat had gone, and my collar had burst away from its",The War of the Worlds_7
36,"fastener. A few minutes before, there had only been three real things",The War of the Worlds_7
36,"before me—the immensity of the night and space and nature, my own",The War of the Worlds_7
36,"feebleness and anguish, and the near approach of death. Now it was as",The War of the Worlds_7
36,"if something turned over, and the point of view altered abruptly. There",The War of the Worlds_7
36,was no sensible transition from one state of mind to the other. I was,The War of the Worlds_7
36,"immediately the self of every day again—a decent, ordinary citizen. The",The War of the Worlds_7
36,"silent common, the impulse of my flight, the starting flames, were as",The War of the Worlds_7
36,if they had been in a dream. I asked myself had these latter things,The War of the Worlds_7
36,indeed happened? I could not credit it.,The War of the Worlds_7
36,,The War of the Worlds_7
36,I rose and walked unsteadily up the steep incline of the bridge. My,The War of the Worlds_7
36,mind was blank wonder. My muscles and nerves seemed drained of their,The War of the Worlds_7
36,"strength. I dare say I staggered drunkenly. A head rose over the arch,",The War of the Worlds_7
36,and the figure of a workman carrying a basket appeared. Beside him ran,The War of the Worlds_7
36,"a little boy. He passed me, wishing me good night. I was minded to",The War of the Worlds_7
36,"speak to him, but did not. I answered his greeting with a meaningless",The War of the Worlds_7
36,mumble and went on over the bridge.,The War of the Worlds_7
36,,The War of the Worlds_7
36,"Over the Maybury arch a train, a billowing tumult of white, firelit",The War of the Worlds_7
36,"smoke, and a long caterpillar of lighted windows, went flying",The War of the Worlds_7
36,"south—clatter, clatter, clap, rap, and it had gone. A dim group of",The War of the Worlds_7
36,people talked in the gate of one of the houses in the pretty little row,The War of the Worlds_7
36,of gables that was called Oriental Terrace. It was all so real and so,The War of the Worlds_7
36,"familiar. And that behind me! It was frantic, fantastic! Such things, I",The War of the Worlds_7
36,"told myself, could not be.",The War of the Worlds_7
36,,The War of the Worlds_7
36,Perhaps I am a man of exceptional moods. I do not know how far my,The War of the Worlds_7
36,experience is common. At times I suffer from the strangest sense of,The War of the Worlds_7
36,detachment from myself and the world about me; I seem to watch it all,The War of the Worlds_7
36,"from the outside, from somewhere inconceivably remote, out of time, out",The War of the Worlds_7
36,"of space, out of the stress and tragedy of it all. This feeling was",The War of the Worlds_7
36,very strong upon me that night. Here was another side to my dream.,The War of the Worlds_7
36,,The War of the Worlds_7
36,But the trouble was the blank incongruity of this serenity and the,The War of the Worlds_7
36,"swift death flying yonder, not two miles away. There was a noise of",The War of the Worlds_7
36,"business from the gasworks, and the electric lamps were all alight. I",The War of the Worlds_7
36,stopped at the group of people.,The War of the Worlds_7
36,,The War of the Worlds_7
36,“What news from the common?” said I.,The War of the Worlds_7
36,,The War of the Worlds_7
36,There were two men and a woman at the gate.,The War of the Worlds_7
36,,The War of the Worlds_7
36,"“Eh?” said one of the men, turning.",The War of the Worlds_7
36,,The War of the Worlds_7
36,“What news from the common?” I said.,The War of the Worlds_7
36,,The War of the Worlds_7
36,“Ain’t yer just _been_ there?” asked the men.,The War of the Worlds_7
36,,The War of the Worlds_7
36,"“People seem fair silly about the common,” said the woman over the",The War of the Worlds_7
36,gate. “What’s it all abart?”,The War of the Worlds_7
36,,The War of the Worlds_7
36,“Haven’t you heard of the men from Mars?” said I; “the creatures from,The War of the Worlds_7
36,Mars?”,The War of the Worlds_7
36,,The War of the Worlds_7
36,"“Quite enough,” said the woman over the gate. “Thenks”; and all three",The War of the Worlds_7
36,of them laughed.,The War of the Worlds_7
36,,The War of the Worlds_7
36,I felt foolish and angry. I tried and found I could not tell them what,The War of the Worlds_7
36,I had seen. They laughed again at my broken sentences.,The War of the Worlds_7
36,,The War of the Worlds_7
36,"“You’ll hear more yet,” I said, and went on to my home.",The War of the Worlds_7
36,,The War of the Worlds_7
36,"I startled my wife at the doorway, so haggard was I. I went into the",The War of the Worlds_7
36,"dining room, sat down, drank some wine, and so soon as I could collect",The War of the Worlds_7
36,"myself sufficiently I told her the things I had seen. The dinner, which",The War of the Worlds_7
36,"was a cold one, had already been served, and remained neglected on the",The War of the Worlds_7
36,table while I told my story.,The War of the Worlds_7
36,,The War of the Worlds_7
36,"“There is one thing,” I said, to allay the fears I had aroused; “they",The War of the Worlds_7
36,are the most sluggish things I ever saw crawl. They may keep the pit,The War of the Worlds_7
36,"and kill people who come near them, but they cannot get out of it. . .",The War of the Worlds_7
36,. But the horror of them!”,The War of the Worlds_7
36,,The War of the Worlds_7
36,"“Don’t, dear!” said my wife, knitting her brows and putting her hand on",The War of the Worlds_7
36,mine.,The War of the Worlds_7
36,,The War of the Worlds_7
36,“Poor Ogilvy!” I said. “To think he may be lying dead there!”,The War of the Worlds_7
36,,The War of the Worlds_7
36,My wife at least did not find my experience incredible. When I saw how,The War of the Worlds_7
36,"deadly white her face was, I ceased abruptly.",The War of the Worlds_7
36,,The War of the Worlds_7
36,"“They may come here,” she said again and again.",The War of the Worlds_7
36,,The War of the Worlds_7
36,"I pressed her to take wine, and tried to reassure her.",The War of the Worlds_7
36,,The War of the Worlds_7
36,"“They can scarcely move,” I said.",The War of the Worlds_7
36,,The War of the Worlds_7
36,I began to comfort her and myself by repeating all that Ogilvy had told,The War of the Worlds_7
36,me of the impossibility of the Martians establishing themselves on the,The War of the Worlds_7
36,earth. In particular I laid stress on the gravitational difficulty. On,The War of the Worlds_7
36,the surface of the earth the force of gravity is three times what it is,The War of the Worlds_7
36,"on the surface of Mars. A Martian, therefore, would weigh three times",The War of the Worlds_7
36,"more than on Mars, albeit his muscular strength would be the same. His",The War of the Worlds_7
36,"own body would be a cope of lead to him, therefore. That, indeed, was",The War of the Worlds_7
36,"the general opinion. Both _The Times_ and the _Daily Telegraph_, for",The War of the Worlds_7
36,"instance, insisted on it the next morning, and both overlooked, just as",The War of the Worlds_7
36,"I did, two obvious modifying influences.",The War of the Worlds_7
36,,The War of the Worlds_7
36,"The atmosphere of the earth, we now know, contains far more oxygen or",The War of the Worlds_7
36,far less argon (whichever way one likes to put it) than does Mars’. The,The War of the Worlds_7
36,invigorating influences of this excess of oxygen upon the Martians,The War of the Worlds_7
36,indisputably did much to counterbalance the increased weight of their,The War of the Worlds_7
36,"bodies. And, in the second place, we all overlooked the fact that such",The War of the Worlds_7
36,mechanical intelligence as the Martian possessed was quite able to,The War of the Worlds_7
36,dispense with muscular exertion at a pinch.,The War of the Worlds_7
36,,The War of the Worlds_7
36,"But I did not consider these points at the time, and so my reasoning",The War of the Worlds_7
36,"was dead against the chances of the invaders. With wine and food, the",The War of the Worlds_7
36,"confidence of my own table, and the necessity of reassuring my wife, I",The War of the Worlds_7
36,grew by insensible degrees courageous and secure.,The War of the Worlds_7

36,"“They have done a foolish thing,” said I, fingering my wineglass. “They",The War of the Worlds_7
36,"are dangerous because, no doubt, they are mad with terror. Perhaps they",The War of the Worlds_7
36,expected to find no living things—certainly no intelligent living,The War of the Worlds_7
36,things.”,The War of the Worlds_7

36,The intense excitement of the events had no doubt left my perceptive,The War of the Worlds_7

36,extraordinary vividness even now. My dear wife’s sweet anxious face,The War of the Worlds_7
36,"peering at me from under the pink lamp shade, the white cloth with its",The War of the Worlds_7
36,silver and glass table furniture—for in those days even philosophical,The War of the Worlds_7
36,"writers had many little luxuries—the crimson-purple wine in my glass,",The War of the Worlds_7
36,"are photographically distinct. At the end of it I sat, tempering nuts",The War of the Worlds_7
36,"with a cigarette, regretting Ogilvy’s rashness, and denouncing the",The War of the Worlds_7
36,short-sighted timidity of the Martians.,The War of the Worlds_7
36,,The War of the Worlds_7
36,So some respectable dodo in the Mauritius might have lorded it in his,The War of the Worlds_7

36,"want of animal food. “We will peck them to death tomorrow, my dear.”",The War of the Worlds_7

36,VIII.,The War of the Worlds_8
36,FRIDAY NIGHT.,The War of the Worlds_8
36,,The War of the Worlds_8
36,,The War of the Worlds_8
36,"The most extraordinary thing to my mind, of all the strange and",The War of the Worlds_8
36,"wonderful things that happened upon that Friday, was the dovetailing of",The War of the Worlds_8
36,the commonplace habits of our social order with the first beginnings of,The War of the Worlds_8
36,the series of events that was to topple that social order headlong. If,The War of the Worlds_8
36,on Friday night you had taken a pair of compasses and drawn a circle,The War of the Worlds_8
36,"with a radius of five miles round the Woking sand-pits, I doubt if you",The War of the Worlds_8
36,"would have had one human being outside it, unless it were some relation",The War of the Worlds_8
36,of Stent or of the three or four cyclists or London people lying dead,The War of the Worlds_8
36,"on the common, whose emotions or habits were at all affected by the",The War of the Worlds_8
36,"new-comers. Many people had heard of the cylinder, of course, and",The War of the Worlds_8
36,"talked about it in their leisure, but it certainly did not make the",The War of the Worlds_8
36,sensation that an ultimatum to Germany would have done.,The War of the Worlds_8
36,,The War of the Worlds_8
36,In London that night poor Henderson’s telegram describing the gradual,The War of the Worlds_8
36,"unscrewing of the shot was judged to be a canard, and his evening",The War of the Worlds_8
36,"paper, after wiring for authentication from him and receiving no",The War of the Worlds_8
36,reply—the man was killed—decided not to print a special edition.,The War of the Worlds_8
36,,The War of the Worlds_8
36,Even within the five-mile circle the great majority of people were,The War of the Worlds_8
36,inert. I have already described the behaviour of the men and women to,The War of the Worlds_8
36,whom I spoke. All over the district people were dining and supping;,The War of the Worlds_8
36,"working men were gardening after the labours of the day, children were",The War of the Worlds_8
36,"being put to bed, young people were wandering through the lanes",The War of the Worlds_8
36,"love-making, students sat over their books.",The War of the Worlds_8
36,,The War of the Worlds_8
36,"Maybe there was a murmur in the village streets, a novel and dominant",The War of the Worlds_8
36,"topic in the public-houses, and here and there a messenger, or even an",The War of the Worlds_8
36,"eye-witness of the later occurrences, caused a whirl of excitement, a",The War of the Worlds_8
36,"shouting, and a running to and fro; but for the most part the daily",The War of the Worlds_8
36,"routine of working, eating, drinking, sleeping, went on as it had done",The War of the Worlds_8
36,for countless years—as though no planet Mars existed in the sky. Even,The War of the Worlds_8
36,at Woking station and Horsell and Chobham that was the case.,The War of the Worlds_8
36,,The War of the Worlds_8
36,"In Woking junction, until a late hour, trains were stopping and going",The War of the Worlds_8
36,"on, others were shunting on the sidings, passengers were alighting and",The War of the Worlds_8
36,"waiting, and everything was proceeding in the most ordinary way. A boy",The War of the Worlds_8
36,"from the town, trenching on Smith’s monopoly, was selling papers with",The War of the Worlds_8
36,"the afternoon’s news. The ringing impact of trucks, the sharp whistle",The War of the Worlds_8
36,"of the engines from the junction, mingled with their shouts of “Men",The War of the Worlds_8
36,from Mars!” Excited men came into the station about nine o’clock with,The War of the Worlds_8
36,"incredible tidings, and caused no more disturbance than drunkards might",The War of the Worlds_8
36,have done. People rattling Londonwards peered into the darkness outside,The War of the Worlds_8
36,"the carriage windows, and saw only a rare, flickering, vanishing spark",The War of the Worlds_8
36,"dance up from the direction of Horsell, a red glow and a thin veil of",The War of the Worlds_8
36,"smoke driving across the stars, and thought that nothing more serious",The War of the Worlds_8
36,than a heath fire was happening. It was only round the edge of the,The War of the Worlds_8
36,common that any disturbance was perceptible. There were half a dozen,The War of the Worlds_8
36,villas burning on the Woking border. There were lights in all the,The War of the Worlds_8
36,"houses on the common side of the three villages, and the people there",The War of the Worlds_8
36,kept awake till dawn.,The War of the Worlds_8
36,,The War of the Worlds_8
36,"A curious crowd lingered restlessly, people coming and going but the",The War of the Worlds_8
36,"crowd remaining, both on the Chobham and Horsell bridges. One or two",The War of the Worlds_8
36,"adventurous souls, it was afterwards found, went into the darkness and",The War of the Worlds_8
36,"crawled quite near the Martians; but they never returned, for now and",The War of the Worlds_8
36,"again a light-ray, like the beam of a warship’s searchlight swept the",The War of the Worlds_8
36,"common, and the Heat-Ray was ready to follow. Save for such, that big",The War of the Worlds_8
36,"area of common was silent and desolate, and the charred bodies lay",The War of the Worlds_8
36,"about on it all night under the stars, and all the next day. A noise of",The War of the Worlds_8
36,hammering from the pit was heard by many people.,The War of the Worlds_8
36,,The War of the Worlds_8
36,"So you have the state of things on Friday night. In the centre,",The War of the Worlds_8
36,"sticking into the skin of our old planet Earth like a poisoned dart,",The War of the Worlds_8
36,was this cylinder. But the poison was scarcely working yet. Around it,The War of the Worlds_8
36,"was a patch of silent common, smouldering in places, and with a few",The War of the Worlds_8
36,"dark, dimly seen objects lying in contorted attitudes here and there.",The War of the Worlds_8
36,Here and there was a burning bush or tree. Beyond was a fringe of,The War of the Worlds_8
36,"excitement, and farther than that fringe the inflammation had not crept",The War of the Worlds_8
36,as yet. In the rest of the world the stream of life still flowed as it,The War of the Worlds_8
36,had flowed for immemorial years. The fever of war that would presently,The War of the Worlds_8
36,"clog vein and artery, deaden nerve and destroy brain, had still to",The War of the Worlds_8
36,develop.,The War of the Worlds_8
36,,The War of the Worlds_8
36,"All night long the Martians were hammering and stirring, sleepless,",The War of the Worlds_8
36,"indefatigable, at work upon the machines they were making ready, and",The War of the Worlds_8
36,ever and again a puff of greenish-white smoke whirled up to the starlit,The War of the Worlds_8
36,sky.,The War of the Worlds_8
36,,The War of the Worlds_8
36,"About eleven a company of soldiers came through Horsell, and deployed",The War of the Worlds_8
36,along the edge of the common to form a cordon. Later a second company,The War of the Worlds_8
36,marched through Chobham to deploy on the north side of the common.,The War of the Worlds_8
36,Several officers from the Inkerman barracks had been on the common,The War of the Worlds_8
36,"earlier in the day, and one, Major Eden, was reported to be missing.",The War of the Worlds_8
36,The colonel of the regiment came to the Chobham bridge and was busy,The War of the Worlds_8
36,questioning the crowd at midnight. The military authorities were,The War of the Worlds_8
36,"certainly alive to the seriousness of the business. About eleven, the",The War of the Worlds_8
36,"next morning’s papers were able to say, a squadron of hussars, two",The War of the Worlds_8
36,"Maxims, and about four hundred men of the Cardigan regiment started",The War of the Worlds_8
36,from Aldershot.,The War of the Worlds_8
36,,The War of the Worlds_8
36,"A few seconds after midnight the crowd in the Chertsey road, Woking,",The War of the Worlds_8
36,saw a star fall from heaven into the pine woods to the northwest. It,The War of the Worlds_8
36,"had a greenish colour, and caused a silent brightness like summer",The War of the Worlds_8

36,THE FIGHTING BEGINS.,The War of the Worlds_9
36,,The War of the Worlds_9
36,,The War of the Worlds_9
36,Saturday lives in my memory as a day of suspense. It was a day of,The War of the Worlds_9
36,"lassitude too, hot and close, with, I am told, a rapidly fluctuating",The War of the Worlds_9
36,"barometer. I had slept but little, though my wife had succeeded in",The War of the Worlds_9
36,"sleeping, and I rose early. I went into my garden before breakfast and",The War of the Worlds_9
36,"stood listening, but towards the common there was nothing stirring but",The War of the Worlds_9
36,a lark.,The War of the Worlds_9
36,,The War of the Worlds_9
36,The milkman came as usual. I heard the rattle of his chariot and I went,The War of the Worlds_9
36,round to the side gate to ask the latest news. He told me that during,The War of the Worlds_9
36,"the night the Martians had been surrounded by troops, and that guns",The War of the Worlds_9
36,"were expected. Then—a familiar, reassuring note—I heard a train running",The War of the Worlds_9
36,towards Woking.,The War of the Worlds_9
36,,The War of the Worlds_9
36,"“They aren’t to be killed,” said the milkman, “if that can possibly be",The War of the Worlds_9
36,avoided.”,The War of the Worlds_9
36,,The War of the Worlds_9
36,"I saw my neighbour gardening, chatted with him for a time, and then",The War of the Worlds_9
36,strolled in to breakfast. It was a most unexceptional morning. My,The War of the Worlds_9
36,neighbour was of opinion that the troops would be able to capture or to,The War of the Worlds_9
36,destroy the Martians during the day.,The War of the Worlds_9
36,,The War of the Worlds_9
36,"“It’s a pity they make themselves so unapproachable,” he said. “It",The War of the Worlds_9
36,would be curious to know how they live on another planet; we might,The War of the Worlds_9
36,learn a thing or two.”,The War of the Worlds_9
36,,The War of the Worlds_9
36,"He came up to the fence and extended a handful of strawberries, for his",The War of the Worlds_9
36,gardening was as generous as it was enthusiastic. At the same time he,The War of the Worlds_9
36,told me of the burning of the pine woods about the Byfleet Golf Links.,The War of the Worlds_9
36,,The War of the Worlds_9
36,"“They say,” said he, “that there’s another of those blessed things",The War of the Worlds_9
36,"fallen there—number two. But one’s enough, surely. This lot’ll cost the",The War of the Worlds_9
36,insurance people a pretty penny before everything’s settled.” He,The War of the Worlds_9
36,laughed with an air of the greatest good humour as he said this. The,The War of the Worlds_9
36,"woods, he said, were still burning, and pointed out a haze of smoke to",The War of the Worlds_9
36,"me. “They will be hot under foot for days, on account of the thick soil",The War of the Worlds_9
36,"of pine needles and turf,” he said, and then grew serious over “poor",The War of the Worlds_9
36,Ogilvy.”,The War of the Worlds_9
36,,The War of the Worlds_9
36,"After breakfast, instead of working, I decided to walk down towards the",The War of the Worlds_9
36,"common. Under the railway bridge I found a group of soldiers—sappers, I",The War of the Worlds_9
36,"think, men in small round caps, dirty red jackets unbuttoned, and",The War of the Worlds_9
36,"showing their blue shirts, dark trousers, and boots coming to the calf.",The War of the Worlds_9
36,"They told me no one was allowed over the canal, and, looking along the",The War of the Worlds_9
36,"road towards the bridge, I saw one of the Cardigan men standing",The War of the Worlds_9
36,sentinel there. I talked with these soldiers for a time; I told them of,The War of the Worlds_9
36,my sight of the Martians on the previous evening. None of them had seen,The War of the Worlds_9
36,"the Martians, and they had but the vaguest ideas of them, so that they",The War of the Worlds_9
36,plied me with questions. They said that they did not know who had,The War of the Worlds_9
36,authorised the movements of the troops; their idea was that a dispute,The War of the Worlds_9
36,had arisen at the Horse Guards. The ordinary sapper is a great deal,The War of the Worlds_9
36,"better educated than the common soldier, and they discussed the",The War of the Worlds_9
36,peculiar conditions of the possible fight with some acuteness. I,The War of the Worlds_9
36,"described the Heat-Ray to them, and they began to argue among",The War of the Worlds_9
36,themselves.,The War of the Worlds_9
36,,The War of the Worlds_9
36,"“Crawl up under cover and rush ’em, say I,” said one.",The War of the Worlds_9
36,,The War of the Worlds_9
36,“Get aht!” said another. “What’s cover against this ’ere ’eat? Sticks,The War of the Worlds_9
36,to cook yer! What we got to do is to go as near as the ground’ll let,The War of the Worlds_9
36,"us, and then drive a trench.”",The War of the Worlds_9
36,,The War of the Worlds_9
36,“Blow yer trenches! You always want trenches; you ought to ha’ been,The War of the Worlds_9
36,born a rabbit Snippy.”,The War of the Worlds_9
36,,The War of the Worlds_9
36,"“Ain’t they got any necks, then?” said a third, abruptly—a little,",The War of the Worlds_9
36,"contemplative, dark man, smoking a pipe.",The War of the Worlds_9
36,,The War of the Worlds_9
36,I repeated my description.,The War of the Worlds_9
36,,The War of the Worlds_9
36,"“Octopuses,” said he, “that’s what I calls ’em. Talk about fishers of",The War of the Worlds_9
36,men—fighters of fish it is this time!”,The War of the Worlds_9
36,,The War of the Worlds_9
36,"“It ain’t no murder killing beasts like that,” said the first speaker.",The War of the Worlds_9
36,,The War of the Worlds_9
36,“Why not shell the darned things strite off and finish ’em?” said the,The War of the Worlds_9
36,little dark man. “You carn tell what they might do.”,The War of the Worlds_9
36,,The War of the Worlds_9
36,“Where’s your shells?” said the first speaker. “There ain’t no time. Do,The War of the Worlds_9
36,"it in a rush, that’s my tip, and do it at once.”",The War of the Worlds_9
36,,The War of the Worlds_9
36,"So they discussed it. After a while I left them, and went on to the",The War of the Worlds_9
36,railway station to get as many morning papers as I could.,The War of the Worlds_9
36,,The War of the Worlds_9
36,But I will not weary the reader with a description of that long morning,The War of the Worlds_9
36,and of the longer afternoon. I did not succeed in getting a glimpse of,The War of the Worlds_9
36,"the common, for even Horsell and Chobham church towers were in the",The War of the Worlds_9
36,hands of the military authorities. The soldiers I addressed didn’t know,The War of the Worlds_9
36,anything; the officers were mysterious as well as busy. I found people,The War of the Worlds_9
36,"in the town quite secure again in the presence of the military, and I",The War of the Worlds_9
36,"heard for the first time from Marshall, the tobacconist, that his son",The War of the Worlds_9
36,was among the dead on the common. The soldiers had made the people on,The War of the Worlds_9
36,the outskirts of Horsell lock up and leave their houses.,The War of the Worlds_9
36,,The War of the Worlds_9
36,"I got back to lunch about two, very tired for, as I have said, the day",The War of the Worlds_9
36,was extremely hot and dull; and in order to refresh myself I took a,The War of the Worlds_9
36,cold bath in the afternoon. About half past four I went up to the,The War of the Worlds_9
36,"railway station to get an evening paper, for the morning papers had",The War of the Worlds_9
36,"contained only a very inaccurate description of the killing of Stent,",The War of the Worlds_9
36,"Henderson, Ogilvy, and the others. But there was little I didn’t know.",The War of the Worlds_9
36,The Martians did not show an inch of themselves. They seemed busy in,The War of the Worlds_9
36,"their pit, and there was a sound of hammering and an almost continuous",The War of the Worlds_9
36,streamer of smoke. Apparently they were busy getting ready for a,The War of the Worlds_9
36,"struggle. “Fresh attempts have been made to signal, but without",The War of the Worlds_9
36,"success,” was the stereotyped formula of the papers. A sapper told me",The War of the Worlds_9
36,it was done by a man in a ditch with a flag on a long pole. The,The War of the Worlds_9
36,Martians took as much notice of such advances as we should of the,The War of the Worlds_9
36,lowing of a cow.,The War of the Worlds_9
36,,The War of the Worlds_9
36,"I must confess the sight of all this armament, all this preparation,",The War of the Worlds_9
36,"greatly excited me. My imagination became belligerent, and defeated the",The War of the Worlds_9
36,invaders in a dozen striking ways; something of my schoolboy dreams of,The War of the Worlds_9
36,battle and heroism came back. It hardly seemed a fair fight to me at,The War of the Worlds_9
36,that time. They seemed very helpless in that pit of theirs.,The War of the Worlds_9
36,,The War of the Worlds_9
36,About three o’clock there began the thud of a gun at measured intervals,The War of the Worlds_9
36,from Chertsey or Addlestone. I learned that the smouldering pine wood,The War of the Worlds_9
36,"into which the second cylinder had fallen was being shelled, in the",The War of the Worlds_9
36,hope of destroying that object before it opened. It was only about,The War of the Worlds_9
36,"five, however, that a field gun reached Chobham for use against the",The War of the Worlds_9
36,first body of Martians.,The War of the Worlds_9
36,,The War of the Worlds_9
36,"About six in the evening, as I sat at tea with my wife in the",The War of the Worlds_9
36,summerhouse talking vigorously about the battle that was lowering upon,The War of the Worlds_9
36,"us, I heard a muffled detonation from the common, and immediately after",The War of the Worlds_9
36,a gust of firing. Close on the heels of that came a violent rattling,The War of the Worlds_9
36,"crash, quite close to us, that shook the ground; and, starting out upon",The War of the Worlds_9
36,"the lawn, I saw the tops of the trees about the Oriental College burst",The War of the Worlds_9
36,"into smoky red flame, and the tower of the little church beside it",The War of the Worlds_9
36,"slide down into ruin. The pinnacle of the mosque had vanished, and the",The War of the Worlds_9
36,roof line of the college itself looked as if a hundred-ton gun had been,The War of the Worlds_9
36,"at work upon it. One of our chimneys cracked as if a shot had hit it,",The War of the Worlds_9
36,"flew, and a piece of it came clattering down the tiles and made a heap",The War of the Worlds_9
36,of broken red fragments upon the flower bed by my study window.,The War of the Worlds_9
36,,The War of the Worlds_9
36,I and my wife stood amazed. Then I realised that the crest of Maybury,The War of the Worlds_9
36,Hill must be within range of the Martians’ Heat-Ray now that the,The War of the Worlds_9
36,college was cleared out of the way.,The War of the Worlds_9
36,,The War of the Worlds_9
36,"At that I gripped my wife’s arm, and without ceremony ran her out into",The War of the Worlds_9
36,"the road. Then I fetched out the servant, telling her I would go",The War of the Worlds_9
36,upstairs myself for the box she was clamouring for.,The War of the Worlds_9
36,,The War of the Worlds_9
36,"“We can’t possibly stay here,” I said; and as I spoke the firing",The War of the Worlds_9
36,reopened for a moment upon the common.,The War of the Worlds_9
36,,The War of the Worlds_9
36,“But where are we to go?” said my wife in terror.,The War of the Worlds_9
36,,The War of the Worlds_9
36,I thought perplexed. Then I remembered her cousins at Leatherhead.,The War of the Worlds_9
36,,The War of the Worlds_9
36,“Leatherhead!” I shouted above the sudden noise.,The War of the Worlds_9
36,,The War of the Worlds_9
36,She looked away from me downhill. The people were coming out of their,The War of the Worlds_9
36,"houses, astonished.",The War of the Worlds_9
36,,The War of the Worlds_9
36,“How are we to get to Leatherhead?” she said.,The War of the Worlds_9
36,,The War of the Worlds_9
36,Down the hill I saw a bevy of hussars ride under the railway bridge;,The War of the Worlds_9
36,three galloped through the open gates of the Oriental College; two,The War of the Worlds_9
36,"others dismounted, and began running from house to house. The sun,",The War of the Worlds_9
36,"shining through the smoke that drove up from the tops of the trees,",The War of the Worlds_9
36,"seemed blood red, and threw an unfamiliar lurid light upon everything.",The War of the Worlds_9
36,,The War of the Worlds_9
36,"“Stop here,” said I; “you are safe here”; and I started off at once for",The War of the Worlds_9
36,"the Spotted Dog, for I knew the landlord had a horse and dog cart. I",The War of the Worlds_9
36,"ran, for I perceived that in a moment everyone upon this side of the",The War of the Worlds_9
36,"hill would be moving. I found him in his bar, quite unaware of what was",The War of the Worlds_9
36,"going on behind his house. A man stood with his back to me, talking to",The War of the Worlds_9
36,him.,The War of the Worlds_9
36,,The War of the Worlds_9
36,"“I must have a pound,” said the landlord, “and I’ve no one to drive",The War of the Worlds_9
36,it.”,The War of the Worlds_9
36,,The War of the Worlds_9
36,"“I’ll give you two,” said I, over the stranger’s shoulder.",The War of the Worlds_9
36,,The War of the Worlds_9
36,“What for?”,The War of the Worlds_9
36,,The War of the Worlds_9
36,"“And I’ll bring it back by midnight,” I said.",The War of the Worlds_9
36,,The War of the Worlds_9
36,“Lord!” said the landlord; “what’s the hurry? I’m selling my bit of a,The War of the Worlds_9
36,"pig. Two pounds, and you bring it back? What’s going on now?”",The War of the Worlds_9
36,,The War of the Worlds_9
36,"I explained hastily that I had to leave my home, and so secured the dog",The War of the Worlds_9
36,cart. At the time it did not seem to me nearly so urgent that the,The War of the Worlds_9
36,"landlord should leave his. I took care to have the cart there and then,",The War of the Worlds_9
36,"drove it off down the road, and, leaving it in charge of my wife and",The War of the Worlds_9
36,"servant, rushed into my house and packed a few valuables, such plate as",The War of the Worlds_9
36,"we had, and so forth. The beech trees below the house were burning",The War of the Worlds_9
36,"while I did this, and the palings up the road glowed red. While I was",The War of the Worlds_9
36,"occupied in this way, one of the dismounted hussars came running up. He",The War of the Worlds_9
36,"was going from house to house, warning people to leave. He was going on",The War of the Worlds_9
36,"as I came out of my front door, lugging my treasures, done up in a",The War of the Worlds_9
36,tablecloth. I shouted after him:,The War of the Worlds_9
36,,The War of the Worlds_9
36,“What news?”,The War of the Worlds_9

36,"He turned, stared, bawled something about “crawling out in a thing like",The War of the Worlds_9
36,"a dish cover,” and ran on to the gate of the house at the crest. A",The War of the Worlds_9
36,sudden whirl of black smoke driving across the road hid him for a,The War of the Worlds_9
36,moment. I ran to my neighbour’s door and rapped to satisfy myself of,The War of the Worlds_9
36,"what I already knew, that his wife had gone to London with him and had",The War of the Worlds_9
36,"locked up their house. I went in again, according to my promise, to get",The War of the Worlds_9
36,"my servant’s box, lugged it out, clapped it beside her on the tail of",The War of the Worlds_9
36,"the dog cart, and then caught the reins and jumped up into the driver’s",The War of the Worlds_9
36,seat beside my wife. In another moment we were clear of the smoke and,The War of the Worlds_9
36,"noise, and spanking down the opposite slope of Maybury Hill towards Old",The War of the Worlds_9
36,Woking.,The War of the Worlds_9
36,,The War of the Worlds_9
36,"In front was a quiet sunny landscape, a wheat field ahead on either",The War of the Worlds_9
36,"side of the road, and the Maybury Inn with its swinging sign. I saw the",The War of the Worlds_9
36,doctor’s cart ahead of me. At the bottom of the hill I turned my head,The War of the Worlds_9
36,to look at the hillside I was leaving. Thick streamers of black smoke,The War of the Worlds_9
36,"shot with threads of red fire were driving up into the still air, and",The War of the Worlds_9
36,throwing dark shadows upon the green treetops eastward. The smoke,The War of the Worlds_9
36,already extended far away to the east and west—to the Byfleet pine,The War of the Worlds_9
36,"woods eastward, and to Woking on the west. The road was dotted with",The War of the Worlds_9
36,"people running towards us. And very faint now, but very distinct",The War of the Worlds_9
36,"through the hot, quiet air, one heard the whirr of a machine-gun that",The War of the Worlds_9
36,"was presently stilled, and an intermittent cracking of rifles.",The War of the Worlds_9
36,Apparently the Martians were setting fire to everything within range of,The War of the Worlds_9
36,their Heat-Ray.,The War of the Worlds_9
36,,The War of the Worlds_9
36,"I am not an expert driver, and I had immediately to turn my attention",The War of the Worlds_9
36,to the horse. When I looked back again the second hill had hidden the,The War of the Worlds_9
36,"black smoke. I slashed the horse with the whip, and gave him a loose",The War of the Worlds_9
36,rein until Woking and Send lay between us and that quivering tumult. I,The War of the Worlds_9
36,overtook and passed the doctor between Woking and Send.,The War of the Worlds_9

36,IN THE STORM.,The War of the Worlds_10
36,,The War of the Worlds_10
36,,The War of the Worlds_10
36,Leatherhead is about twelve miles from Maybury Hill. The scent of hay,The War of the Worlds_10
36,"was in the air through the lush meadows beyond Pyrford, and the hedges",The War of the Worlds_10
36,on either side were sweet and gay with multitudes of dog-roses. The,The War of the Worlds_10
36,heavy firing that had broken out while we were driving down Maybury,The War of the Worlds_10
36,"Hill ceased as abruptly as it began, leaving the evening very peaceful",The War of the Worlds_10
36,and still. We got to Leatherhead without misadventure about nine,The War of the Worlds_10
36,"o’clock, and the horse had an hour’s rest while I took supper with my",The War of the Worlds_10
36,cousins and commended my wife to their care.,The War of the Worlds_10
36,,The War of the Worlds_10
36,"My wife was curiously silent throughout the drive, and seemed oppressed",The War of the Worlds_10
36,"with forebodings of evil. I talked to her reassuringly, pointing out",The War of the Worlds_10
36,"that the Martians were tied to the pit by sheer heaviness, and at the",The War of the Worlds_10
36,utmost could but crawl a little out of it; but she answered only in,The War of the Worlds_10
36,"monosyllables. Had it not been for my promise to the innkeeper, she",The War of the Worlds_10
36,"would, I think, have urged me to stay in Leatherhead that night. Would",The War of the Worlds_10
36,"that I had! Her face, I remember, was very white as we parted.",The War of the Worlds_10
36,,The War of the Worlds_10
36,"For my own part, I had been feverishly excited all day. Something very",The War of the Worlds_10
36,like the war fever that occasionally runs through a civilised community,The War of the Worlds_10
36,"had got into my blood, and in my heart I was not so very sorry that I",The War of the Worlds_10
36,had to return to Maybury that night. I was even afraid that that last,The War of the Worlds_10
36,fusillade I had heard might mean the extermination of our invaders from,The War of the Worlds_10
36,Mars. I can best express my state of mind by saying that I wanted to be,The War of the Worlds_10
36,in at the death.,The War of the Worlds_10
36,,The War of the Worlds_10
36,It was nearly eleven when I started to return. The night was,The War of the Worlds_10
36,"unexpectedly dark; to me, walking out of the lighted passage of my",The War of the Worlds_10
36,"cousins’ house, it seemed indeed black, and it was as hot and close as",The War of the Worlds_10
36,"the day. Overhead the clouds were driving fast, albeit not a breath",The War of the Worlds_10
36,"stirred the shrubs about us. My cousins’ man lit both lamps. Happily, I",The War of the Worlds_10
36,"knew the road intimately. My wife stood in the light of the doorway,",The War of the Worlds_10
36,and watched me until I jumped up into the dog cart. Then abruptly she,The War of the Worlds_10
36,"turned and went in, leaving my cousins side by side wishing me good",The War of the Worlds_10
36,hap.,The War of the Worlds_10
36,,The War of the Worlds_10
36,I was a little depressed at first with the contagion of my wife’s,The War of the Worlds_10
36,"fears, but very soon my thoughts reverted to the Martians. At that time",The War of the Worlds_10
36,I was absolutely in the dark as to the course of the evening’s,The War of the Worlds_10
36,fighting. I did not know even the circumstances that had precipitated,The War of the Worlds_10
36,the conflict. As I came through Ockham (for that was the way I,The War of the Worlds_10
36,"returned, and not through Send and Old Woking) I saw along the western",The War of the Worlds_10
36,"horizon a blood-red glow, which as I drew nearer, crept slowly up the",The War of the Worlds_10
36,sky. The driving clouds of the gathering thunderstorm mingled there,The War of the Worlds_10
36,with masses of black and red smoke.,The War of the Worlds_10
36,,The War of the Worlds_10
36,"Ripley Street was deserted, and except for a lighted window or so the",The War of the Worlds_10
36,village showed not a sign of life; but I narrowly escaped an accident,The War of the Worlds_10
36,"at the corner of the road to Pyrford, where a knot of people stood with",The War of the Worlds_10
36,their backs to me. They said nothing to me as I passed. I do not know,The War of the Worlds_10
36,"what they knew of the things happening beyond the hill, nor do I know",The War of the Worlds_10
36,"if the silent houses I passed on my way were sleeping securely, or",The War of the Worlds_10
36,"deserted and empty, or harassed and watching against the terror of the",The War of the Worlds_10
36,night.,The War of the Worlds_10
36,,The War of the Worlds_10
36,From Ripley until I came through Pyrford I was in the valley of the,The War of the Worlds_10
36,"Wey, and the red glare was hidden from me. As I ascended the little",The War of the Worlds_10
36,"hill beyond Pyrford Church the glare came into view again, and the",The War of the Worlds_10
36,trees about me shivered with the first intimation of the storm that was,The War of the Worlds_10
36,upon me. Then I heard midnight pealing out from Pyrford Church behind,The War of the Worlds_10
36,"me, and then came the silhouette of Maybury Hill, with its tree-tops",The War of the Worlds_10
36,and roofs black and sharp against the red.,The War of the Worlds_10
36,,The War of the Worlds_10
36,Even as I beheld this a lurid green glare lit the road about me and,The War of the Worlds_10
36,showed the distant woods towards Addlestone. I felt a tug at the reins.,The War of the Worlds_10
36,I saw that the driving clouds had been pierced as it were by a thread,The War of the Worlds_10
36,"of green fire, suddenly lighting their confusion and falling into the",The War of the Worlds_10
36,field to my left. It was the third falling star!,The War of the Worlds_10
36,,The War of the Worlds_10
36,"Close on its apparition, and blindingly violet by contrast, danced out",The War of the Worlds_10
36,"the first lightning of the gathering storm, and the thunder burst like",The War of the Worlds_10
36,a rocket overhead. The horse took the bit between his teeth and bolted.,The War of the Worlds_10
36,,The War of the Worlds_10
36,"A moderate incline runs towards the foot of Maybury Hill, and down this",The War of the Worlds_10
36,"we clattered. Once the lightning had begun, it went on in as rapid a",The War of the Worlds_10
36,"succession of flashes as I have ever seen. The thunderclaps, treading",The War of the Worlds_10
36,"one on the heels of another and with a strange crackling accompaniment,",The War of the Worlds_10
36,sounded more like the working of a gigantic electric machine than the,The War of the Worlds_10
36,usual detonating reverberations. The flickering light was blinding and,The War of the Worlds_10
36,"confusing, and a thin hail smote gustily at my face as I drove down the",The War of the Worlds_10
36,slope.,The War of the Worlds_10
36,,The War of the Worlds_10
36,"At first I regarded little but the road before me, and then abruptly my",The War of the Worlds_10
36,attention was arrested by something that was moving rapidly down the,The War of the Worlds_10
36,opposite slope of Maybury Hill. At first I took it for the wet roof of,The War of the Worlds_10
36,"a house, but one flash following another showed it to be in swift",The War of the Worlds_10
36,rolling movement. It was an elusive vision—a moment of bewildering,The War of the Worlds_10
36,"darkness, and then, in a flash like daylight, the red masses of the",The War of the Worlds_10
36,"Orphanage near the crest of the hill, the green tops of the pine trees,",The War of the Worlds_10
36,and this problematical object came out clear and sharp and bright.,The War of the Worlds_10
36,,The War of the Worlds_10
36,"And this Thing I saw! How can I describe it? A monstrous tripod, higher",The War of the Worlds_10
36,"than many houses, striding over the young pine trees, and smashing them",The War of the Worlds_10
36,"aside in its career; a walking engine of glittering metal, striding now",The War of the Worlds_10
36,"across the heather; articulate ropes of steel dangling from it, and the",The War of the Worlds_10
36,clattering tumult of its passage mingling with the riot of the thunder.,The War of the Worlds_10
36,"A flash, and it came out vividly, heeling over one way with two feet in",The War of the Worlds_10
36,"the air, to vanish and reappear almost instantly as it seemed, with the",The War of the Worlds_10
36,"next flash, a hundred yards nearer. Can you imagine a milking stool",The War of the Worlds_10
36,tilted and bowled violently along the ground? That was the impression,The War of the Worlds_10
36,those instant flashes gave. But instead of a milking stool imagine it a,The War of the Worlds_10
36,great body of machinery on a tripod stand.,The War of the Worlds_10
36,,The War of the Worlds_10
36,"Then suddenly the trees in the pine wood ahead of me were parted, as",The War of the Worlds_10
36,brittle reeds are parted by a man thrusting through them; they were,The War of the Worlds_10
36,"snapped off and driven headlong, and a second huge tripod appeared,",The War of the Worlds_10
36,"rushing, as it seemed, headlong towards me. And I was galloping hard to",The War of the Worlds_10
36,meet it! At the sight of the second monster my nerve went altogether.,The War of the Worlds_10
36,"Not stopping to look again, I wrenched the horse’s head hard round to",The War of the Worlds_10
36,the right and in another moment the dog cart had heeled over upon the,The War of the Worlds_10
36,"horse; the shafts smashed noisily, and I was flung sideways and fell",The War of the Worlds_10
36,heavily into a shallow pool of water.,The War of the Worlds_10
36,,The War of the Worlds_10
36,"I crawled out almost immediately, and crouched, my feet still in the",The War of the Worlds_10
36,"water, under a clump of furze. The horse lay motionless (his neck was",The War of the Worlds_10
36,"broken, poor brute!) and by the lightning flashes I saw the black bulk",The War of the Worlds_10
36,of the overturned dog cart and the silhouette of the wheel still,The War of the Worlds_10
36,spinning slowly. In another moment the colossal mechanism went striding,The War of the Worlds_10
36,"by me, and passed uphill towards Pyrford.",The War of the Worlds_10
36,,The War of the Worlds_10
36,"Seen nearer, the Thing was incredibly strange, for it was no mere",The War of the Worlds_10
36,"insensate machine driving on its way. Machine it was, with a ringing",The War of the Worlds_10
36,"metallic pace, and long, flexible, glittering tentacles (one of which",The War of the Worlds_10
36,gripped a young pine tree) swinging and rattling about its strange,The War of the Worlds_10
36,"body. It picked its road as it went striding along, and the brazen hood",The War of the Worlds_10
36,that surmounted it moved to and fro with the inevitable suggestion of a,The War of the Worlds_10
36,head looking about. Behind the main body was a huge mass of white metal,The War of the Worlds_10
36,"like a gigantic fisherman’s basket, and puffs of green smoke squirted",The War of the Worlds_10
36,out from the joints of the limbs as the monster swept by me. And in an,The War of the Worlds_10
36,instant it was gone.,The War of the Worlds_10
36,,The War of the Worlds_10
36,"So much I saw then, all vaguely for the flickering of the lightning, in",The War of the Worlds_10
36,blinding highlights and dense black shadows.,The War of the Worlds_10
36,,The War of the Worlds_10
36,As it passed it set up an exultant deafening howl that drowned the,The War of the Worlds_10
36,"thunder—“Aloo! Aloo!”—and in another minute it was with its companion,",The War of the Worlds_10
36,"half a mile away, stooping over something in the field. I have no doubt",The War of the Worlds_10
36,this Thing in the field was the third of the ten cylinders they had,The War of the Worlds_10
36,fired at us from Mars.,The War of the Worlds_10
36,,The War of the Worlds_10
36,"For some minutes I lay there in the rain and darkness watching, by the",The War of the Worlds_10
36,"intermittent light, these monstrous beings of metal moving about in the",The War of the Worlds_10
36,"distance over the hedge tops. A thin hail was now beginning, and as it",The War of the Worlds_10
36,came and went their figures grew misty and then flashed into clearness,The War of the Worlds_10
36,"again. Now and then came a gap in the lightning, and the night",The War of the Worlds_10
36,swallowed them up.,The War of the Worlds_10
36,,The War of the Worlds_10
36,I was soaked with hail above and puddle water below. It was some time,The War of the Worlds_10
36,before my blank astonishment would let me struggle up the bank to a,The War of the Worlds_10
36,"drier position, or think at all of my imminent peril.",The War of the Worlds_10
36,,The War of the Worlds_10
36,"Not far from me was a little one-roomed squatter’s hut of wood,",The War of the Worlds_10
36,"surrounded by a patch of potato garden. I struggled to my feet at last,",The War of the Worlds_10
36,"and, crouching and making use of every chance of cover, I made a run",The War of the Worlds_10
36,"for this. I hammered at the door, but I could not make the people hear",The War of the Worlds_10
36,"(if there were any people inside), and after a time I desisted, and,",The War of the Worlds_10
36,"availing myself of a ditch for the greater part of the way, succeeded",The War of the Worlds_10
36,"in crawling, unobserved by these monstrous machines, into the pine",The War of the Worlds_10
36,woods towards Maybury.,The War of the Worlds_10
36,,The War of the Worlds_10
36,"Under cover of this I pushed on, wet and shivering now, towards my own",The War of the Worlds_10
36,house. I walked among the trees trying to find the footpath. It was,The War of the Worlds_10
36,"very dark indeed in the wood, for the lightning was now becoming",The War of the Worlds_10
36,"infrequent, and the hail, which was pouring down in a torrent, fell in",The War of the Worlds_10
36,columns through the gaps in the heavy foliage.,The War of the Worlds_10
36,,The War of the Worlds_10
36,If I had fully realised the meaning of all the things I had seen I,The War of the Worlds_10
36,should have immediately worked my way round through Byfleet to Street,The War of the Worlds_10
36,"Cobham, and so gone back to rejoin my wife at Leatherhead. But that",The War of the Worlds_10
36,"night the strangeness of things about me, and my physical wretchedness,",The War of the Worlds_10
36,"prevented me, for I was bruised, weary, wet to the skin, deafened and",The War of the Worlds_10
36,blinded by the storm.,The War of the Worlds_10
36,,The War of the Worlds_10
36,"I had a vague idea of going on to my own house, and that was as much",The War of the Worlds_10
36,"motive as I had. I staggered through the trees, fell into a ditch and",The War of the Worlds_10
36,"bruised my knees against a plank, and finally splashed out into the",The War of the Worlds_10
36,"lane that ran down from the College Arms. I say splashed, for the storm",The War of the Worlds_10
36,water was sweeping the sand down the hill in a muddy torrent. There in,The War of the Worlds_10
36,the darkness a man blundered into me and sent me reeling back.,The War of the Worlds_10
36,,The War of the Worlds_10
36,"He gave a cry of terror, sprang sideways, and rushed on before I could",The War of the Worlds_10
36,gather my wits sufficiently to speak to him. So heavy was the stress of,The War of the Worlds_10
36,the storm just at this place that I had the hardest task to win my way,The War of the Worlds_10
36,up the hill. I went close up to the fence on the left and worked my way,The War of the Worlds_10
36,along its palings.,The War of the Worlds_10
36,,The War of the Worlds_10
36,"Near the top I stumbled upon something soft, and, by a flash of",The War of the Worlds_10
36,"lightning, saw between my feet a heap of black broadcloth and a pair of",The War of the Worlds_10
36,"boots. Before I could distinguish clearly how the man lay, the flicker",The War of the Worlds_10
36,of light had passed. I stood over him waiting for the next flash. When,The War of the Worlds_10
36,"it came, I saw that he was a sturdy man, cheaply but not shabbily",The War of the Worlds_10
36,"dressed; his head was bent under his body, and he lay crumpled up close",The War of the Worlds_10
36,"to the fence, as though he had been flung violently against it.",The War of the Worlds_10
36,,The War of the Worlds_10
36,Overcoming the repugnance natural to one who had never before touched a,The War of the Worlds_10
36,"dead body, I stooped and turned him over to feel for his heart. He was",The War of the Worlds_10
36,quite dead. Apparently his neck had been broken. The lightning flashed,The War of the Worlds_10
36,"for a third time, and his face leaped upon me. I sprang to my feet. It",The War of the Worlds_10
36,"was the landlord of the Spotted Dog, whose conveyance I had taken.",The War of the Worlds_10
36,,The War of the Worlds_10
36,I stepped over him gingerly and pushed on up the hill. I made my way by,The War of the Worlds_10
36,the police station and the College Arms towards my own house. Nothing,The War of the Worlds_10
36,"was burning on the hillside, though from the common there still came a",The War of the Worlds_10
36,red glare and a rolling tumult of ruddy smoke beating up against the,The War of the Worlds_10
36,"drenching hail. So far as I could see by the flashes, the houses about",The War of the Worlds_10
36,me were mostly uninjured. By the College Arms a dark heap lay in the,The War of the Worlds_10
36,road.,The War of the Worlds_10
36,,The War of the Worlds_10
36,Down the road towards Maybury Bridge there were voices and the sound of,The War of the Worlds_10
36,"feet, but I had not the courage to shout or to go to them. I let myself",The War of the Worlds_10
36,"in with my latchkey, closed, locked and bolted the door, staggered to",The War of the Worlds_10
36,"the foot of the staircase, and sat down. My imagination was full of",The War of the Worlds_10
36,"those striding metallic monsters, and of the dead body smashed against",The War of the Worlds_10
36,the fence.,The War of the Worlds_10
36,,The War of the Worlds_10
36,"I crouched at the foot of the staircase with my back to the wall,",The War of the Worlds_10
36,shivering violently.,The War of the Worlds_10

36,AT THE WINDOW.,The War of the Worlds_11
36,,The War of the Worlds_11
36,,The War of the Worlds_11
36,I have already said that my storms of emotion have a trick of,The War of the Worlds_11
36,exhausting themselves. After a time I discovered that I was cold and,The War of the Worlds_11
36,"wet, and with little pools of water about me on the stair carpet. I got",The War of the Worlds_11
36,"up almost mechanically, went into the dining room and drank some",The War of the Worlds_11
36,"whisky, and then I was moved to change my clothes.",The War of the Worlds_11
36,,The War of the Worlds_11
36,"After I had done that I went upstairs to my study, but why I did so I",The War of the Worlds_11
36,do not know. The window of my study looks over the trees and the,The War of the Worlds_11
36,railway towards Horsell Common. In the hurry of our departure this,The War of the Worlds_11
36,"window had been left open. The passage was dark, and, by contrast with",The War of the Worlds_11
36,"the picture the window frame enclosed, the side of the room seemed",The War of the Worlds_11
36,impenetrably dark. I stopped short in the doorway.,The War of the Worlds_11
36,,The War of the Worlds_11
36,The thunderstorm had passed. The towers of the Oriental College and the,The War of the Worlds_11
36,"pine trees about it had gone, and very far away, lit by a vivid red",The War of the Worlds_11
36,"glare, the common about the sand-pits was visible. Across the light",The War of the Worlds_11
36,"huge black shapes, grotesque and strange, moved busily to and fro.",The War of the Worlds_11
36,,The War of the Worlds_11
36,It seemed indeed as if the whole country in that direction was on,The War of the Worlds_11
36,"fire—a broad hillside set with minute tongues of flame, swaying and",The War of the Worlds_11
36,"writhing with the gusts of the dying storm, and throwing a red",The War of the Worlds_11
36,reflection upon the cloud scud above. Every now and then a haze of,The War of the Worlds_11
36,smoke from some nearer conflagration drove across the window and hid,The War of the Worlds_11
36,"the Martian shapes. I could not see what they were doing, nor the clear",The War of the Worlds_11
36,"form of them, nor recognise the black objects they were busied upon.",The War of the Worlds_11
36,"Neither could I see the nearer fire, though the reflections of it",The War of the Worlds_11
36,"danced on the wall and ceiling of the study. A sharp, resinous tang of",The War of the Worlds_11
36,burning was in the air.,The War of the Worlds_11
36,,The War of the Worlds_11
36,I closed the door noiselessly and crept towards the window. As I did,The War of the Worlds_11
36,"so, the view opened out until, on the one hand, it reached to the",The War of the Worlds_11
36,"houses about Woking station, and on the other to the charred and",The War of the Worlds_11
36,"blackened pine woods of Byfleet. There was a light down below the hill,",The War of the Worlds_11
36,"on the railway, near the arch, and several of the houses along the",The War of the Worlds_11
36,Maybury road and the streets near the station were glowing ruins. The,The War of the Worlds_11
36,light upon the railway puzzled me at first; there were a black heap and,The War of the Worlds_11
36,"a vivid glare, and to the right of that a row of yellow oblongs. Then I",The War of the Worlds_11
36,"perceived this was a wrecked train, the fore part smashed and on fire,",The War of the Worlds_11
36,the hinder carriages still upon the rails.,The War of the Worlds_11
36,,The War of the Worlds_11
36,"Between these three main centres of light—the houses, the train, and",The War of the Worlds_11
36,the burning county towards Chobham—stretched irregular patches of dark,The War of the Worlds_11
36,"country, broken here and there by intervals of dimly glowing and",The War of the Worlds_11
36,"smoking ground. It was the strangest spectacle, that black expanse set",The War of the Worlds_11
36,"with fire. It reminded me, more than anything else, of the Potteries at",The War of the Worlds_11
36,"night. At first I could distinguish no people at all, though I peered",The War of the Worlds_11
36,intently for them. Later I saw against the light of Woking station a,The War of the Worlds_11
36,number of black figures hurrying one after the other across the line.,The War of the Worlds_11
36,,The War of the Worlds_11
36,And this was the little world in which I had been living securely for,The War of the Worlds_11
36,"years, this fiery chaos! What had happened in the last seven hours I",The War of the Worlds_11
36,"still did not know; nor did I know, though I was beginning to guess,",The War of the Worlds_11
36,the relation between these mechanical colossi and the sluggish lumps I,The War of the Worlds_11
36,had seen disgorged from the cylinder. With a queer feeling of,The War of the Worlds_11
36,"impersonal interest I turned my desk chair to the window, sat down, and",The War of the Worlds_11
36,"stared at the blackened country, and particularly at the three gigantic",The War of the Worlds_11
36,black things that were going to and fro in the glare about the,The War of the Worlds_11
36,sand-pits.,The War of the Worlds_11
36,,The War of the Worlds_11
36,They seemed amazingly busy. I began to ask myself what they could be.,The War of the Worlds_11
36,Were they intelligent mechanisms? Such a thing I felt was impossible.,The War of the Worlds_11
36,"Or did a Martian sit within each, ruling, directing, using, much as a",The War of the Worlds_11
36,man’s brain sits and rules in his body? I began to compare the things,The War of the Worlds_11
36,"to human machines, to ask myself for the first time in my life how an",The War of the Worlds_11
36,ironclad or a steam engine would seem to an intelligent lower animal.,The War of the Worlds_11
36,,The War of the Worlds_11
36,"The storm had left the sky clear, and over the smoke of the burning",The War of the Worlds_11
36,"land the little fading pinpoint of Mars was dropping into the west,",The War of the Worlds_11
36,when a soldier came into my garden. I heard a slight scraping at the,The War of the Worlds_11
36,"fence, and rousing myself from the lethargy that had fallen upon me, I",The War of the Worlds_11
36,"looked down and saw him dimly, clambering over the palings. At the",The War of the Worlds_11
36,"sight of another human being my torpor passed, and I leaned out of the",The War of the Worlds_11
36,window eagerly.,The War of the Worlds_11
36,,The War of the Worlds_11
36,"“Hist!” said I, in a whisper.",The War of the Worlds_11
36,,The War of the Worlds_11
36,He stopped astride of the fence in doubt. Then he came over and across,The War of the Worlds_11
36,the lawn to the corner of the house. He bent down and stepped softly.,The War of the Worlds_11
36,,The War of the Worlds_11
36,"“Who’s there?” he said, also whispering, standing under the window and",The War of the Worlds_11
36,peering up.,The War of the Worlds_11
36,,The War of the Worlds_11
36,“Where are you going?” I asked.,The War of the Worlds_11
36,,The War of the Worlds_11
36,“God knows.”,The War of the Worlds_11
36,,The War of the Worlds_11
36,“Are you trying to hide?”,The War of the Worlds_11
36,,The War of the Worlds_11
36,“That’s it.”,The War of the Worlds_11
36,,The War of the Worlds_11
36,"“Come into the house,” I said.",The War of the Worlds_11
36,,The War of the Worlds_11
36,"I went down, unfastened the door, and let him in, and locked the door",The War of the Worlds_11
36,"again. I could not see his face. He was hatless, and his coat was",The War of the Worlds_11
36,unbuttoned.,The War of the Worlds_11
36,,The War of the Worlds_11
36,"“My God!” he said, as I drew him in.",The War of the Worlds_11
36,,The War of the Worlds_11
36,“What has happened?” I asked.,The War of the Worlds_11
36,,The War of the Worlds_11
36,“What hasn’t?” In the obscurity I could see he made a gesture of,The War of the Worlds_11
36,"despair. “They wiped us out—simply wiped us out,” he repeated again and",The War of the Worlds_11
36,again.,The War of the Worlds_11
36,,The War of the Worlds_11
36,"He followed me, almost mechanically, into the dining room.",The War of the Worlds_11
36,,The War of the Worlds_11
36,"“Take some whisky,” I said, pouring out a stiff dose.",The War of the Worlds_11
36,,The War of the Worlds_11
36,"He drank it. Then abruptly he sat down before the table, put his head",The War of the Worlds_11
36,"on his arms, and began to sob and weep like a little boy, in a perfect",The War of the Worlds_11
36,"passion of emotion, while I, with a curious forgetfulness of my own",The War of the Worlds_11
36,"recent despair, stood beside him, wondering.",The War of the Worlds_11
36,,The War of the Worlds_11
36,It was a long time before he could steady his nerves to answer my,The War of the Worlds_11
36,"questions, and then he answered perplexingly and brokenly. He was a",The War of the Worlds_11
36,"driver in the artillery, and had only come into action about seven. At",The War of the Worlds_11
36,"that time firing was going on across the common, and it was said the",The War of the Worlds_11
36,first party of Martians were crawling slowly towards their second,The War of the Worlds_11
36,cylinder under cover of a metal shield.,The War of the Worlds_11
36,,The War of the Worlds_11
36,Later this shield staggered up on tripod legs and became the first of,The War of the Worlds_11
36,the fighting-machines I had seen. The gun he drove had been unlimbered,The War of the Worlds_11
36,"near Horsell, in order to command the sand-pits, and its arrival it was",The War of the Worlds_11
36,that had precipitated the action. As the limber gunners went to the,The War of the Worlds_11
36,"rear, his horse trod in a rabbit hole and came down, throwing him into",The War of the Worlds_11
36,a depression of the ground. At the same moment the gun exploded behind,The War of the Worlds_11
36,"him, the ammunition blew up, there was fire all about him, and he found",The War of the Worlds_11
36,himself lying under a heap of charred dead men and dead horses.,The War of the Worlds_11
36,,The War of the Worlds_11
36,"“I lay still,” he said, “scared out of my wits, with the fore quarter",The War of the Worlds_11
36,of a horse atop of me. We’d been wiped out. And the smell—good God!,The War of the Worlds_11
36,"Like burnt meat! I was hurt across the back by the fall of the horse,",The War of the Worlds_11
36,and there I had to lie until I felt better. Just like parade it had,The War of the Worlds_11
36,"been a minute before—then stumble, bang, swish!”",The War of the Worlds_11
36,,The War of the Worlds_11
36,“Wiped out!” he said.,The War of the Worlds_11
36,,The War of the Worlds_11
36,"He had hid under the dead horse for a long time, peeping out furtively",The War of the Worlds_11
36,"across the common. The Cardigan men had tried a rush, in skirmishing",The War of the Worlds_11
36,"order, at the pit, simply to be swept out of existence. Then the",The War of the Worlds_11
36,monster had risen to its feet and had begun to walk leisurely to and,The War of the Worlds_11
36,"fro across the common among the few fugitives, with its headlike hood",The War of the Worlds_11
36,turning about exactly like the head of a cowled human being. A kind of,The War of the Worlds_11
36,"arm carried a complicated metallic case, about which green flashes",The War of the Worlds_11
36,"scintillated, and out of the funnel of this there smoked the Heat-Ray.",The War of the Worlds_11
36,,The War of the Worlds_11
36,"In a few minutes there was, so far as the soldier could see, not a",The War of the Worlds_11
36,"living thing left upon the common, and every bush and tree upon it that",The War of the Worlds_11
36,was not already a blackened skeleton was burning. The hussars had been,The War of the Worlds_11
36,"on the road beyond the curvature of the ground, and he saw nothing of",The War of the Worlds_11
36,them. He heard the Maxims rattle for a time and then become still. The,The War of the Worlds_11
36,giant saved Woking station and its cluster of houses until the last;,The War of the Worlds_11
36,"then in a moment the Heat-Ray was brought to bear, and the town became",The War of the Worlds_11
36,"a heap of fiery ruins. Then the Thing shut off the Heat-Ray, and",The War of the Worlds_11
36,"turning its back upon the artilleryman, began to waddle away towards",The War of the Worlds_11
36,the smouldering pine woods that sheltered the second cylinder. As it,The War of the Worlds_11
36,did so a second glittering Titan built itself up out of the pit.,The War of the Worlds_11
36,,The War of the Worlds_11
36,"The second monster followed the first, and at that the artilleryman",The War of the Worlds_11
36,began to crawl very cautiously across the hot heather ash towards,The War of the Worlds_11
36,Horsell. He managed to get alive into the ditch by the side of the,The War of the Worlds_11
36,"road, and so escaped to Woking. There his story became ejaculatory. The",The War of the Worlds_11
36,"place was impassable. It seems there were a few people alive there,",The War of the Worlds_11
36,frantic for the most part and many burned and scalded. He was turned,The War of the Worlds_11
36,"aside by the fire, and hid among some almost scorching heaps of broken",The War of the Worlds_11
36,wall as one of the Martian giants returned. He saw this one pursue a,The War of the Worlds_11
36,"man, catch him up in one of its steely tentacles, and knock his head",The War of the Worlds_11
36,"against the trunk of a pine tree. At last, after nightfall, the",The War of the Worlds_11
36,artilleryman made a rush for it and got over the railway embankment.,The War of the Worlds_11
36,,The War of the Worlds_11
36,"Since then he had been skulking along towards Maybury, in the hope of",The War of the Worlds_11
36,getting out of danger Londonward. People were hiding in trenches and,The War of the Worlds_11
36,"cellars, and many of the survivors had made off towards Woking village",The War of the Worlds_11
36,and Send. He had been consumed with thirst until he found one of the,The War of the Worlds_11
36,"water mains near the railway arch smashed, and the water bubbling out",The War of the Worlds_11
36,like a spring upon the road.,The War of the Worlds_11
36,,The War of the Worlds_11
36,"That was the story I got from him, bit by bit. He grew calmer telling",The War of the Worlds_11
36,me and trying to make me see the things he had seen. He had eaten no,The War of the Worlds_11
36,"food since midday, he told me early in his narrative, and I found some",The War of the Worlds_11
36,mutton and bread in the pantry and brought it into the room. We lit no,The War of the Worlds_11
36,"lamp for fear of attracting the Martians, and ever and again our hands",The War of the Worlds_11
36,"would touch upon bread or meat. As he talked, things about us came",The War of the Worlds_11
36,"darkly out of the darkness, and the trampled bushes and broken rose",The War of the Worlds_11
36,trees outside the window grew distinct. It would seem that a number of,The War of the Worlds_11
36,"men or animals had rushed across the lawn. I began to see his face,",The War of the Worlds_11
36,"blackened and haggard, as no doubt mine was also.",The War of the Worlds_11
36,,The War of the Worlds_11
36,"When we had finished eating we went softly upstairs to my study, and I",The War of the Worlds_11
36,looked again out of the open window. In one night the valley had become,The War of the Worlds_11
36,a valley of ashes. The fires had dwindled now. Where flames had been,The War of the Worlds_11
36,there were now streamers of smoke; but the countless ruins of shattered,The War of the Worlds_11
36,and gutted houses and blasted and blackened trees that the night had,The War of the Worlds_11
36,hidden stood out now gaunt and terrible in the pitiless light of dawn.,The War of the Worlds_11
36,Yet here and there some object had had the luck to escape—a white,The War of the Worlds_11
36,"railway signal here, the end of a greenhouse there, white and fresh",The War of the Worlds_11
36,amid the wreckage. Never before in the history of warfare had,The War of the Worlds_11
36,destruction been so indiscriminate and so universal. And shining with,The War of the Worlds_11
36,"the growing light of the east, three of the metallic giants stood about",The War of the Worlds_11
36,"the pit, their cowls rotating as though they were surveying the",The War of the Worlds_11
36,desolation they had made.,The War of the Worlds_11
36,,The War of the Worlds_11
36,"It seemed to me that the pit had been enlarged, and ever and again",The War of the Worlds_11
36,puffs of vivid green vapour streamed up and out of it towards the,The War of the Worlds_11
36,"brightening dawn—streamed up, whirled, broke, and vanished.",The War of the Worlds_11
36,,The War of the Worlds_11
36,Beyond were the pillars of fire about Chobham. They became pillars of,The War of the Worlds_11
36,bloodshot smoke at the first touch of day.,The War of the Worlds_11
36,,The War of the Worlds_11
36,,The War of the Worlds_11
36,,The War of the Worlds_11
36,,The War of the Worlds_11
36,XII.,The War of the Worlds_12
36,WHAT I SAW OF THE DESTRUCTION OF WEYBRIDGE AND SHEPPERTON.,The War of the Worlds_12
36,,The War of the Worlds_12
36,,The War of the Worlds_12
36,As the dawn grew brighter we withdrew from the window from which we had,The War of the Worlds_12
36,"watched the Martians, and went very quietly downstairs.",The War of the Worlds_12
36,,The War of the Worlds_12
36,The artilleryman agreed with me that the house was no place to stay in.,The War of the Worlds_12
36,"He proposed, he said, to make his way Londonward, and thence rejoin his",The War of the Worlds_12
36,"battery—No. 12, of the Horse Artillery. My plan was to return at once",The War of the Worlds_12
36,to Leatherhead; and so greatly had the strength of the Martians,The War of the Worlds_12
36,"impressed me that I had determined to take my wife to Newhaven, and go",The War of the Worlds_12
36,with her out of the country forthwith. For I already perceived clearly,The War of the Worlds_12
36,that the country about London must inevitably be the scene of a,The War of the Worlds_12
36,disastrous struggle before such creatures as these could be destroyed.,The War of the Worlds_12
36,,The War of the Worlds_12
36,"Between us and Leatherhead, however, lay the third cylinder, with its",The War of the Worlds_12
36,"guarding giants. Had I been alone, I think I should have taken my",The War of the Worlds_12
36,chance and struck across country. But the artilleryman dissuaded me:,The War of the Worlds_12
36,"“It’s no kindness to the right sort of wife,” he said, “to make her a",The War of the Worlds_12
36,"widow”; and in the end I agreed to go with him, under cover of the",The War of the Worlds_12
36,"woods, northward as far as Street Cobham before I parted with him.",The War of the Worlds_12
36,Thence I would make a big detour by Epsom to reach Leatherhead.,The War of the Worlds_12
36,,The War of the Worlds_12
36,"I should have started at once, but my companion had been in active",The War of the Worlds_12
36,service and he knew better than that. He made me ransack the house for,The War of the Worlds_12
36,"a flask, which he filled with whisky; and we lined every available",The War of the Worlds_12
36,pocket with packets of biscuits and slices of meat. Then we crept out,The War of the Worlds_12
36,"of the house, and ran as quickly as we could down the ill-made road by",The War of the Worlds_12
36,which I had come overnight. The houses seemed deserted. In the road lay,The War of the Worlds_12
36,"a group of three charred bodies close together, struck dead by the",The War of the Worlds_12
36,Heat-Ray; and here and there were things that people had dropped—a,The War of the Worlds_12
36,"clock, a slipper, a silver spoon, and the like poor valuables. At the",The War of the Worlds_12
36,"corner turning up towards the post office a little cart, filled with",The War of the Worlds_12
36,"boxes and furniture, and horseless, heeled over on a broken wheel. A",The War of the Worlds_12
36,cash box had been hastily smashed open and thrown under the debris.,The War of the Worlds_12
36,,The War of the Worlds_12
36,"Except the lodge at the Orphanage, which was still on fire, none of the",The War of the Worlds_12
36,houses had suffered very greatly here. The Heat-Ray had shaved the,The War of the Worlds_12
36,"chimney tops and passed. Yet, save ourselves, there did not seem to be",The War of the Worlds_12
36,a living soul on Maybury Hill. The majority of the inhabitants had,The War of the Worlds_12
36,"escaped, I suppose, by way of the Old Woking road—the road I had taken",The War of the Worlds_12
36,when I drove to Leatherhead—or they had hidden.,The War of the Worlds_12
36,,The War of the Worlds_12
36,"We went down the lane, by the body of the man in black, sodden now from",The War of the Worlds_12
36,"the overnight hail, and broke into the woods at the foot of the hill.",The War of the Worlds_12
36,We pushed through these towards the railway without meeting a soul. The,The War of the Worlds_12
36,woods across the line were but the scarred and blackened ruins of,The War of the Worlds_12
36,"woods; for the most part the trees had fallen, but a certain proportion",The War of the Worlds_12
36,"still stood, dismal grey stems, with dark brown foliage instead of",The War of the Worlds_12
36,green.,The War of the Worlds_12
36,,The War of the Worlds_12
36,On our side the fire had done no more than scorch the nearer trees; it,The War of the Worlds_12
36,had failed to secure its footing. In one place the woodmen had been at,The War of the Worlds_12
36,"work on Saturday; trees, felled and freshly trimmed, lay in a clearing,",The War of the Worlds_12
36,with heaps of sawdust by the sawing-machine and its engine. Hard by was,The War of the Worlds_12
36,"a temporary hut, deserted. There was not a breath of wind this morning,",The War of the Worlds_12
36,"and everything was strangely still. Even the birds were hushed, and as",The War of the Worlds_12
36,we hurried along I and the artilleryman talked in whispers and looked,The War of the Worlds_12
36,now and again over our shoulders. Once or twice we stopped to listen.,The War of the Worlds_12
36,,The War of the Worlds_12
36,"After a time we drew near the road, and as we did so we heard the",The War of the Worlds_12
36,clatter of hoofs and saw through the tree stems three cavalry soldiers,The War of the Worlds_12
36,"riding slowly towards Woking. We hailed them, and they halted while we",The War of the Worlds_12
36,hurried towards them. It was a lieutenant and a couple of privates of,The War of the Worlds_12
36,"the 8th Hussars, with a stand like a theodolite, which the artilleryman",The War of the Worlds_12
36,told me was a heliograph.,The War of the Worlds_12
36,,The War of the Worlds_12
36,"“You are the first men I’ve seen coming this way this morning,” said",The War of the Worlds_12
36,the lieutenant. “What’s brewing?”,The War of the Worlds_12
36,,The War of the Worlds_12
36,His voice and face were eager. The men behind him stared curiously. The,The War of the Worlds_12
36,artilleryman jumped down the bank into the road and saluted.,The War of the Worlds_12
36,,The War of the Worlds_12
36,"“Gun destroyed last night, sir. Have been hiding. Trying to rejoin",The War of the Worlds_12
36,"battery, sir. You’ll come in sight of the Martians, I expect, about",The War of the Worlds_12
36,half a mile along this road.”,The War of the Worlds_12
36,,The War of the Worlds_12
36,“What the dickens are they like?” asked the lieutenant.,The War of the Worlds_12
36,,The War of the Worlds_12
36,"“Giants in armour, sir. Hundred feet high. Three legs and a body like",The War of the Worlds_12
36,"’luminium, with a mighty great head in a hood, sir.”",The War of the Worlds_12
36,,The War of the Worlds_12
36,“Get out!” said the lieutenant. “What confounded nonsense!”,The War of the Worlds_12
36,,The War of the Worlds_12
36,"“You’ll see, sir. They carry a kind of box, sir, that shoots fire and",The War of the Worlds_12
36,strikes you dead.”,The War of the Worlds_12
36,,The War of the Worlds_12
36,“What d’ye mean—a gun?”,The War of the Worlds_12
36,,The War of the Worlds_12
36,"“No, sir,” and the artilleryman began a vivid account of the Heat-Ray.",The War of the Worlds_12
36,"Halfway through, the lieutenant interrupted him and looked up at me. I",The War of the Worlds_12
36,was still standing on the bank by the side of the road.,The War of the Worlds_12
36,,The War of the Worlds_12
36,"“It’s perfectly true,” I said.",The War of the Worlds_12
36,,The War of the Worlds_12
36,"“Well,” said the lieutenant, “I suppose it’s my business to see it too.",The War of the Worlds_12
36,Look here”—to the artilleryman—“we’re detailed here clearing people out,The War of the Worlds_12
36,of their houses. You’d better go along and report yourself to,The War of the Worlds_12
36,"Brigadier-General Marvin, and tell him all you know. He’s at Weybridge.",The War of the Worlds_12
36,Know the way?”,The War of the Worlds_12
36,,The War of the Worlds_12
36,"“I do,” I said; and he turned his horse southward again.",The War of the Worlds_12
36,,The War of the Worlds_12
36,"“Half a mile, you say?” said he.",The War of the Worlds_12
36,,The War of the Worlds_12
36,"“At most,” I answered, and pointed over the treetops southward. He",The War of the Worlds_12
36,"thanked me and rode on, and we saw them no more.",The War of the Worlds_12
36,,The War of the Worlds_12
36,Farther along we came upon a group of three women and two children in,The War of the Worlds_12
36,"the road, busy clearing out a labourer’s cottage. They had got hold of",The War of the Worlds_12
36,"a little hand truck, and were piling it up with unclean-looking bundles",The War of the Worlds_12
36,and shabby furniture. They were all too assiduously engaged to talk to,The War of the Worlds_12
36,us as we passed.,The War of the Worlds_12
36,,The War of the Worlds_12
36,"By Byfleet station we emerged from the pine trees, and found the",The War of the Worlds_12
36,country calm and peaceful under the morning sunlight. We were far,The War of the Worlds_12
36,"beyond the range of the Heat-Ray there, and had it not been for the",The War of the Worlds_12
36,"silent desertion of some of the houses, the stirring movement of",The War of the Worlds_12
36,"packing in others, and the knot of soldiers standing on the bridge over",The War of the Worlds_12
36,"the railway and staring down the line towards Woking, the day would",The War of the Worlds_12
36,have seemed very like any other Sunday.,The War of the Worlds_12
36,,The War of the Worlds_12
36,Several farm waggons and carts were moving creakily along the road to,The War of the Worlds_12
36,"Addlestone, and suddenly through the gate of a field we saw, across a",The War of the Worlds_12
36,"stretch of flat meadow, six twelve-pounders standing neatly at equal",The War of the Worlds_12
36,distances pointing towards Woking. The gunners stood by the guns,The War of the Worlds_12
36,"waiting, and the ammunition waggons were at a business-like distance.",The War of the Worlds_12
36,The men stood almost as if under inspection.,The War of the Worlds_12
36,,The War of the Worlds_12
36,"“That’s good!” said I. “They will get one fair shot, at any rate.”",The War of the Worlds_12
36,,The War of the Worlds_12
36,The artilleryman hesitated at the gate.,The War of the Worlds_12
36,,The War of the Worlds_12
36,"“I shall go on,” he said.",The War of the Worlds_12
36,,The War of the Worlds_12
36,"Farther on towards Weybridge, just over the bridge, there were a number",The War of the Worlds_12
36,"of men in white fatigue jackets throwing up a long rampart, and more",The War of the Worlds_12
36,guns behind.,The War of the Worlds_12
36,,The War of the Worlds_12
36,"“It’s bows and arrows against the lightning, anyhow,” said the",The War of the Worlds_12
36,artilleryman. “They ’aven’t seen that fire-beam yet.”,The War of the Worlds_12
36,,The War of the Worlds_12
36,The officers who were not actively engaged stood and stared over the,The War of the Worlds_12
36,"treetops southwestward, and the men digging would stop every now and",The War of the Worlds_12
36,again to stare in the same direction.,The War of the Worlds_12
36,,The War of the Worlds_12
36,"Byfleet was in a tumult; people packing, and a score of hussars, some",The War of the Worlds_12
36,"of them dismounted, some on horseback, were hunting them about. Three",The War of the Worlds_12
36,"or four black government waggons, with crosses in white circles, and an",The War of the Worlds_12
36,"old omnibus, among other vehicles, were being loaded in the village",The War of the Worlds_12
36,"street. There were scores of people, most of them sufficiently",The War of the Worlds_12
36,sabbatical to have assumed their best clothes. The soldiers were having,The War of the Worlds_12
36,the greatest difficulty in making them realise the gravity of their,The War of the Worlds_12
36,position. We saw one shrivelled old fellow with a huge box and a score,The War of the Worlds_12
36,"or more of flower pots containing orchids, angrily expostulating with",The War of the Worlds_12
36,the corporal who would leave them behind. I stopped and gripped his,The War of the Worlds_12
36,arm.,The War of the Worlds_12
36,,The War of the Worlds_12
36,"“Do you know what’s over there?” I said, pointing at the pine tops that",The War of the Worlds_12
36,hid the Martians.,The War of the Worlds_12
36,,The War of the Worlds_12
36,"“Eh?” said he, turning. “I was explainin’ these is vallyble.”",The War of the Worlds_12
36,,The War of the Worlds_12
36,“Death!” I shouted. “Death is coming! Death!” and leaving him to digest,The War of the Worlds_12
36,"that if he could, I hurried on after the artillery-man. At the corner I",The War of the Worlds_12
36,"looked back. The soldier had left him, and he was still standing by his",The War of the Worlds_12
36,"box, with the pots of orchids on the lid of it, and staring vaguely",The War of the Worlds_12
36,over the trees.,The War of the Worlds_12
36,,The War of the Worlds_12
36,No one in Weybridge could tell us where the headquarters were,The War of the Worlds_12
36,established; the whole place was in such confusion as I had never seen,The War of the Worlds_12
36,"in any town before. Carts, carriages everywhere, the most astonishing",The War of the Worlds_12
36,miscellany of conveyances and horseflesh. The respectable inhabitants,The War of the Worlds_12
36,"of the place, men in golf and boating costumes, wives prettily dressed,",The War of the Worlds_12
36,"were packing, river-side loafers energetically helping, children",The War of the Worlds_12
36,"excited, and, for the most part, highly delighted at this astonishing",The War of the Worlds_12
36,variation of their Sunday experiences. In the midst of it all the,The War of the Worlds_12
36,"worthy vicar was very pluckily holding an early celebration, and his",The War of the Worlds_12
36,bell was jangling out above the excitement.,The War of the Worlds_12
36,,The War of the Worlds_12
36,"I and the artilleryman, seated on the step of the drinking fountain,",The War of the Worlds_12
36,made a very passable meal upon what we had brought with us. Patrols of,The War of the Worlds_12
36,"soldiers—here no longer hussars, but grenadiers in white—were warning",The War of the Worlds_12
36,people to move now or to take refuge in their cellars as soon as the,The War of the Worlds_12
36,firing began. We saw as we crossed the railway bridge that a growing,The War of the Worlds_12
36,"crowd of people had assembled in and about the railway station, and the",The War of the Worlds_12
36,swarming platform was piled with boxes and packages. The ordinary,The War of the Worlds_12
36,"traffic had been stopped, I believe, in order to allow of the passage",The War of the Worlds_12
36,"of troops and guns to Chertsey, and I have heard since that a savage",The War of the Worlds_12
36,struggle occurred for places in the special trains that were put on at,The War of the Worlds_12
36,a later hour.,The War of the Worlds_12
36,,The War of the Worlds_12
36,"We remained at Weybridge until midday, and at that hour we found",The War of the Worlds_12
36,ourselves at the place near Shepperton Lock where the Wey and Thames,The War of the Worlds_12
36,join. Part of the time we spent helping two old women to pack a little,The War of the Worlds_12
36,"cart. The Wey has a treble mouth, and at this point boats are to be",The War of the Worlds_12
36,"hired, and there was a ferry across the river. On the Shepperton side",The War of the Worlds_12
36,"was an inn with a lawn, and beyond that the tower of Shepperton",The War of the Worlds_12
36,Church—it has been replaced by a spire—rose above the trees.,The War of the Worlds_12
36,,The War of the Worlds_12
36,Here we found an excited and noisy crowd of fugitives. As yet the,The War of the Worlds_12
36,"flight had not grown to a panic, but there were already far more people",The War of the Worlds_12
36,than all the boats going to and fro could enable to cross. People came,The War of the Worlds_12
36,panting along under heavy burdens; one husband and wife were even,The War of the Worlds_12
36,"carrying a small outhouse door between them, with some of their",The War of the Worlds_12
36,household goods piled thereon. One man told us he meant to try to get,The War of the Worlds_12
36,away from Shepperton station.,The War of the Worlds_12
36,,The War of the Worlds_12
36,"There was a lot of shouting, and one man was even jesting. The idea",The War of the Worlds_12
36,people seemed to have here was that the Martians were simply formidable,The War of the Worlds_12
36,"human beings, who might attack and sack the town, to be certainly",The War of the Worlds_12
36,destroyed in the end. Every now and then people would glance nervously,The War of the Worlds_12
36,"across the Wey, at the meadows towards Chertsey, but everything over",The War of the Worlds_12
36,there was still.,The War of the Worlds_12
36,,The War of the Worlds_12
36,"Across the Thames, except just where the boats landed, everything was",The War of the Worlds_12
36,"quiet, in vivid contrast with the Surrey side. The people who landed",The War of the Worlds_12
36,there from the boats went tramping off down the lane. The big ferryboat,The War of the Worlds_12
36,had just made a journey. Three or four soldiers stood on the lawn of,The War of the Worlds_12
36,"the inn, staring and jesting at the fugitives, without offering to",The War of the Worlds_12
36,"help. The inn was closed, as it was now within prohibited hours.",The War of the Worlds_12
36,,The War of the Worlds_12
36,"“What’s that?” cried a boatman, and “Shut up, you fool!” said a man",The War of the Worlds_12
36,"near me to a yelping dog. Then the sound came again, this time from the",The War of the Worlds_12
36,"direction of Chertsey, a muffled thud—the sound of a gun.",The War of the Worlds_12
36,,The War of the Worlds_12
36,The fighting was beginning. Almost immediately unseen batteries across,The War of the Worlds_12
36,"the river to our right, unseen because of the trees, took up the",The War of the Worlds_12
36,"chorus, firing heavily one after the other. A woman screamed. Everyone",The War of the Worlds_12
36,"stood arrested by the sudden stir of battle, near us and yet invisible",The War of the Worlds_12
36,"to us. Nothing was to be seen save flat meadows, cows feeding",The War of the Worlds_12
36,"unconcernedly for the most part, and silvery pollard willows motionless",The War of the Worlds_12
36,in the warm sunlight.,The War of the Worlds_12
36,,The War of the Worlds_12
36,"“The sojers’ll stop ’em,” said a woman beside me, doubtfully. A",The War of the Worlds_12
36,haziness rose over the treetops.,The War of the Worlds_12
36,,The War of the Worlds_12
36,"Then suddenly we saw a rush of smoke far away up the river, a puff of",The War of the Worlds_12
36,smoke that jerked up into the air and hung; and forthwith the ground,The War of the Worlds_12
36,"heaved under foot and a heavy explosion shook the air, smashing two or",The War of the Worlds_12
36,"three windows in the houses near, and leaving us astonished.",The War of the Worlds_12
36,,The War of the Worlds_12
36,“Here they are!” shouted a man in a blue jersey. “Yonder! D’yer see,The War of the Worlds_12
36,them? Yonder!”,The War of the Worlds_12
36,,The War of the Worlds_12
36,"Quickly, one after the other, one, two, three, four of the armoured",The War of the Worlds_12
36,"Martians appeared, far away over the little trees, across the flat",The War of the Worlds_12
36,"meadows that stretched towards Chertsey, and striding hurriedly towards",The War of the Worlds_12
36,"the river. Little cowled figures they seemed at first, going with a",The War of the Worlds_12
36,rolling motion and as fast as flying birds.,The War of the Worlds_12
36,,The War of the Worlds_12
36,"Then, advancing obliquely towards us, came a fifth. Their armoured",The War of the Worlds_12
36,bodies glittered in the sun as they swept swiftly forward upon the,The War of the Worlds_12
36,"guns, growing rapidly larger as they drew nearer. One on the extreme",The War of the Worlds_12
36,"left, the remotest that is, flourished a huge case high in the air, and",The War of the Worlds_12
36,"the ghostly, terrible Heat-Ray I had already seen on Friday night smote",The War of the Worlds_12
36,"towards Chertsey, and struck the town.",The War of the Worlds_12
36,,The War of the Worlds_12
36,"At sight of these strange, swift, and terrible creatures the crowd near",The War of the Worlds_12
36,the water’s edge seemed to me to be for a moment horror-struck. There,The War of the Worlds_12
36,"was no screaming or shouting, but a silence. Then a hoarse murmur and a",The War of the Worlds_12
36,"movement of feet—a splashing from the water. A man, too frightened to",The War of the Worlds_12
36,"drop the portmanteau he carried on his shoulder, swung round and sent",The War of the Worlds_12
36,me staggering with a blow from the corner of his burden. A woman thrust,The War of the Worlds_12
36,at me with her hand and rushed past me. I turned with the rush of the,The War of the Worlds_12
36,"people, but I was not too terrified for thought. The terrible Heat-Ray",The War of the Worlds_12
36,was in my mind. To get under water! That was it!,The War of the Worlds_12
36,,The War of the Worlds_12
36,"“Get under water!” I shouted, unheeded.",The War of the Worlds_12
36,,The War of the Worlds_12
36,"I faced about again, and rushed towards the approaching Martian, rushed",The War of the Worlds_12
36,right down the gravelly beach and headlong into the water. Others did,The War of the Worlds_12
36,the same. A boatload of people putting back came leaping out as I,The War of the Worlds_12
36,"rushed past. The stones under my feet were muddy and slippery, and the",The War of the Worlds_12
36,river was so low that I ran perhaps twenty feet scarcely waist-deep.,The War of the Worlds_12
36,"Then, as the Martian towered overhead scarcely a couple of hundred",The War of the Worlds_12
36,"yards away, I flung myself forward under the surface. The splashes of",The War of the Worlds_12
36,the people in the boats leaping into the river sounded like,The War of the Worlds_12
36,thunderclaps in my ears. People were landing hastily on both sides of,The War of the Worlds_12
36,the river. But the Martian machine took no more notice for the moment,The War of the Worlds_12
36,of the people running this way and that than a man would of the,The War of the Worlds_12
36,"confusion of ants in a nest against which his foot has kicked. When,",The War of the Worlds_12
36,"half suffocated, I raised my head above water, the Martian’s hood",The War of the Worlds_12
36,"pointed at the batteries that were still firing across the river, and",The War of the Worlds_12
36,as it advanced it swung loose what must have been the generator of the,The War of the Worlds_12
36,Heat-Ray.,The War of the Worlds_12
36,,The War of the Worlds_12
36,"In another moment it was on the bank, and in a stride wading halfway",The War of the Worlds_12
36,"across. The knees of its foremost legs bent at the farther bank, and in",The War of the Worlds_12
36,"another moment it had raised itself to its full height again, close to",The War of the Worlds_12
36,"the village of Shepperton. Forthwith the six guns which, unknown to",The War of the Worlds_12
36,"anyone on the right bank, had been hidden behind the outskirts of that",The War of the Worlds_12
36,"village, fired simultaneously. The sudden near concussion, the last",The War of the Worlds_12
36,"close upon the first, made my heart jump. The monster was already",The War of the Worlds_12
36,raising the case generating the Heat-Ray as the first shell burst six,The War of the Worlds_12
36,yards above the hood.,The War of the Worlds_12
36,,The War of the Worlds_12
36,I gave a cry of astonishment. I saw and thought nothing of the other,The War of the Worlds_12
36,four Martian monsters; my attention was riveted upon the nearer,The War of the Worlds_12
36,incident. Simultaneously two other shells burst in the air near the,The War of the Worlds_12
36,"body as the hood twisted round in time to receive, but not in time to",The War of the Worlds_12
36,"dodge, the fourth shell.",The War of the Worlds_12
36,,The War of the Worlds_12
36,"The shell burst clean in the face of the Thing. The hood bulged,",The War of the Worlds_12
36,"flashed, was whirled off in a dozen tattered fragments of red flesh and",The War of the Worlds_12
36,glittering metal.,The War of the Worlds_12
36,,The War of the Worlds_12
36,"“Hit!” shouted I, with something between a scream and a cheer.",The War of the Worlds_12
36,,The War of the Worlds_12
36,I heard answering shouts from the people in the water about me. I could,The War of the Worlds_12
36,have leaped out of the water with that momentary exultation.,The War of the Worlds_12
36,,The War of the Worlds_12
36,The decapitated colossus reeled like a drunken giant; but it did not,The War of the Worlds_12
36,"fall over. It recovered its balance by a miracle, and, no longer",The War of the Worlds_12
36,heeding its steps and with the camera that fired the Heat-Ray now,The War of the Worlds_12
36,"rigidly upheld, it reeled swiftly upon Shepperton. The living",The War of the Worlds_12
36,"intelligence, the Martian within the hood, was slain and splashed to",The War of the Worlds_12
36,"the four winds of heaven, and the Thing was now but a mere intricate",The War of the Worlds_12
36,device of metal whirling to destruction. It drove along in a straight,The War of the Worlds_12
36,"line, incapable of guidance. It struck the tower of Shepperton Church,",The War of the Worlds_12
36,"smashing it down as the impact of a battering ram might have done,",The War of the Worlds_12
36,"swerved aside, blundered on and collapsed with tremendous force into",The War of the Worlds_12
36,the river out of my sight.,The War of the Worlds_12
36,,The War of the Worlds_12
36,"A violent explosion shook the air, and a spout of water, steam, mud,",The War of the Worlds_12
36,and shattered metal shot far up into the sky. As the camera of the,The War of the Worlds_12
36,"Heat-Ray hit the water, the latter had immediately flashed into steam.",The War of the Worlds_12
36,"In another moment a huge wave, like a muddy tidal bore but almost",The War of the Worlds_12
36,"scaldingly hot, came sweeping round the bend upstream. I saw people",The War of the Worlds_12
36,"struggling shorewards, and heard their screaming and shouting faintly",The War of the Worlds_12
36,above the seething and roar of the Martian’s collapse.,The War of the Worlds_12
36,,The War of the Worlds_12
36,"For a moment I heeded nothing of the heat, forgot the patent need of",The War of the Worlds_12
36,"self-preservation. I splashed through the tumultuous water, pushing",The War of the Worlds_12
36,"aside a man in black to do so, until I could see round the bend. Half a",The War of the Worlds_12
36,dozen deserted boats pitched aimlessly upon the confusion of the waves.,The War of the Worlds_12
36,"The fallen Martian came into sight downstream, lying across the river,",The War of the Worlds_12
36,and for the most part submerged.,The War of the Worlds_12
36,,The War of the Worlds_12
36,"Thick clouds of steam were pouring off the wreckage, and through the",The War of the Worlds_12
36,"tumultuously whirling wisps I could see, intermittently and vaguely,",The War of the Worlds_12
36,the gigantic limbs churning the water and flinging a splash and spray,The War of the Worlds_12
36,of mud and froth into the air. The tentacles swayed and struck like,The War of the Worlds_12
36,"living arms, and, save for the helpless purposelessness of these",The War of the Worlds_12
36,"movements, it was as if some wounded thing were struggling for its life",The War of the Worlds_12
36,amid the waves. Enormous quantities of a ruddy-brown fluid were,The War of the Worlds_12
36,spurting up in noisy jets out of the machine.,The War of the Worlds_12
36,,The War of the Worlds_12
36,"My attention was diverted from this death flurry by a furious yelling,",The War of the Worlds_12
36,like that of the thing called a siren in our manufacturing towns. A,The War of the Worlds_12
36,"man, knee-deep near the towing path, shouted inaudibly to me and",The War of the Worlds_12
36,"pointed. Looking back, I saw the other Martians advancing with gigantic",The War of the Worlds_12
36,strides down the riverbank from the direction of Chertsey. The,The War of the Worlds_12
36,Shepperton guns spoke this time unavailingly.,The War of the Worlds_12
36,,The War of the Worlds_12
36,"At that I ducked at once under water, and, holding my breath until",The War of the Worlds_12
36,"movement was an agony, blundered painfully ahead under the surface as",The War of the Worlds_12
36,"long as I could. The water was in a tumult about me, and rapidly",The War of the Worlds_12
36,growing hotter.,The War of the Worlds_12
36,,The War of the Worlds_12
36,When for a moment I raised my head to take breath and throw the hair,The War of the Worlds_12
36,"and water from my eyes, the steam was rising in a whirling white fog",The War of the Worlds_12
36,that at first hid the Martians altogether. The noise was deafening.,The War of the Worlds_12
36,"Then I saw them dimly, colossal figures of grey, magnified by the mist.",The War of the Worlds_12
36,"They had passed by me, and two were stooping over the frothing,",The War of the Worlds_12
36,tumultuous ruins of their comrade.,The War of the Worlds_12
36,,The War of the Worlds_12
36,"The third and fourth stood beside him in the water, one perhaps two",The War of the Worlds_12
36,"hundred yards from me, the other towards Laleham. The generators of the",The War of the Worlds_12
36,"Heat-Rays waved high, and the hissing beams smote down this way and",The War of the Worlds_12
36,that.,The War of the Worlds_12
36,,The War of the Worlds_12
36,"The air was full of sound, a deafening and confusing conflict of",The War of the Worlds_12
36,"noises—the clangorous din of the Martians, the crash of falling houses,",The War of the Worlds_12
36,"the thud of trees, fences, sheds flashing into flame, and the crackling",The War of the Worlds_12
36,and roaring of fire. Dense black smoke was leaping up to mingle with,The War of the Worlds_12
36,"the steam from the river, and as the Heat-Ray went to and fro over",The War of the Worlds_12
36,"Weybridge its impact was marked by flashes of incandescent white, that",The War of the Worlds_12
36,gave place at once to a smoky dance of lurid flames. The nearer houses,The War of the Worlds_12
36,"still stood intact, awaiting their fate, shadowy, faint and pallid in",The War of the Worlds_12
36,"the steam, with the fire behind them going to and fro.",The War of the Worlds_12
36,,The War of the Worlds_12
36,"For a moment perhaps I stood there, breast-high in the almost boiling",The War of the Worlds_12
36,"water, dumbfounded at my position, hopeless of escape. Through the reek",The War of the Worlds_12
36,I could see the people who had been with me in the river scrambling out,The War of the Worlds_12
36,"of the water through the reeds, like little frogs hurrying through",The War of the Worlds_12
36,"grass from the advance of a man, or running to and fro in utter dismay",The War of the Worlds_12
36,on the towing path.,The War of the Worlds_12
36,,The War of the Worlds_12
36,Then suddenly the white flashes of the Heat-Ray came leaping towards,The War of the Worlds_12
36,"me. The houses caved in as they dissolved at its touch, and darted out",The War of the Worlds_12
36,flames; the trees changed to fire with a roar. The Ray flickered up and,The War of the Worlds_12
36,"down the towing path, licking off the people who ran this way and that,",The War of the Worlds_12
36,and came down to the water’s edge not fifty yards from where I stood.,The War of the Worlds_12
36,"It swept across the river to Shepperton, and the water in its track",The War of the Worlds_12
36,rose in a boiling weal crested with steam. I turned shoreward.,The War of the Worlds_12
36,,The War of the Worlds_12
36,"In another moment the huge wave, well-nigh at the boiling-point had",The War of the Worlds_12
36,"rushed upon me. I screamed aloud, and scalded, half blinded, agonised,",The War of the Worlds_12
36,"I staggered through the leaping, hissing water towards the shore. Had",The War of the Worlds_12
36,"my foot stumbled, it would have been the end. I fell helplessly, in",The War of the Worlds_12
36,"full sight of the Martians, upon the broad, bare gravelly spit that",The War of the Worlds_12
36,runs down to mark the angle of the Wey and Thames. I expected nothing,The War of the Worlds_12
36,but death.,The War of the Worlds_12
36,,The War of the Worlds_12
36,I have a dim memory of the foot of a Martian coming down within a score,The War of the Worlds_12
36,"of yards of my head, driving straight into the loose gravel, whirling",The War of the Worlds_12
36,"it this way and that and lifting again; of a long suspense, and then of",The War of the Worlds_12
36,"the four carrying the debris of their comrade between them, now clear",The War of the Worlds_12
36,"and then presently faint through a veil of smoke, receding",The War of the Worlds_12
36,"interminably, as it seemed to me, across a vast space of river and",The War of the Worlds_12
36,"meadow. And then, very slowly, I realised that by a miracle I had",The War of the Worlds_12
36,escaped.,The War of the Worlds_12
36,,The War of the Worlds_12

36,,The War of the Worlds_13
36,"After getting this sudden lesson in the power of terrestrial weapons,",The War of the Worlds_13
36,the Martians retreated to their original position upon Horsell Common;,The War of the Worlds_13
36,"and in their haste, and encumbered with the debris of their smashed",The War of the Worlds_13
36,"companion, they no doubt overlooked many such a stray and negligible",The War of the Worlds_13
36,"victim as myself. Had they left their comrade and pushed on forthwith,",The War of the Worlds_13
36,there was nothing at that time between them and London but batteries of,The War of the Worlds_13
36,"twelve-pounder guns, and they would certainly have reached the capital",The War of the Worlds_13
36,"in advance of the tidings of their approach; as sudden, dreadful, and",The War of the Worlds_13
36,destructive their advent would have been as the earthquake that,The War of the Worlds_13
36,destroyed Lisbon a century ago.,The War of the Worlds_13
36,,The War of the Worlds_13
36,But they were in no hurry. Cylinder followed cylinder on its,The War of the Worlds_13
36,interplanetary flight; every twenty-four hours brought them,The War of the Worlds_13
36,"reinforcement. And meanwhile the military and naval authorities, now",The War of the Worlds_13
36,"fully alive to the tremendous power of their antagonists, worked with",The War of the Worlds_13
36,"furious energy. Every minute a fresh gun came into position until,",The War of the Worlds_13
36,"before twilight, every copse, every row of suburban villas on the hilly",The War of the Worlds_13
36,"slopes about Kingston and Richmond, masked an expectant black muzzle.",The War of the Worlds_13
36,And through the charred and desolated area—perhaps twenty square miles,The War of the Worlds_13
36,"altogether—that encircled the Martian encampment on Horsell Common,",The War of the Worlds_13
36,"through charred and ruined villages among the green trees, through the",The War of the Worlds_13
36,blackened and smoking arcades that had been but a day ago pine,The War of the Worlds_13
36,"spinneys, crawled the devoted scouts with the heliographs that were",The War of the Worlds_13
36,presently to warn the gunners of the Martian approach. But the Martians,The War of the Worlds_13
36,now understood our command of artillery and the danger of human,The War of the Worlds_13
36,"proximity, and not a man ventured within a mile of either cylinder,",The War of the Worlds_13
36,save at the price of his life.,The War of the Worlds_13
36,,The War of the Worlds_13
36,It would seem that these giants spent the earlier part of the afternoon,The War of the Worlds_13
36,"in going to and fro, transferring everything from the second and third",The War of the Worlds_13
36,cylinders—the second in Addlestone Golf Links and the third at,The War of the Worlds_13
36,"Pyrford—to their original pit on Horsell Common. Over that, above the",The War of the Worlds_13
36,"blackened heather and ruined buildings that stretched far and wide,",The War of the Worlds_13
36,"stood one as sentinel, while the rest abandoned their vast",The War of the Worlds_13

36,"there far into the night, and the towering pillar of dense green smoke",The War of the Worlds_13
36,"that rose therefrom could be seen from the hills about Merrow, and",The War of the Worlds_13
36,"even, it is said, from Banstead and Epsom Downs.",The War of the Worlds_13
36,,The War of the Worlds_13
36,And while the Martians behind me were thus preparing for their next,The War of the Worlds_13
36,"sally, and in front of me Humanity gathered for the battle, I made my",The War of the Worlds_13
36,way with infinite pains and labour from the fire and smoke of burning,The War of the Worlds_13
36,Weybridge towards London.,The War of the Worlds_13
36,,The War of the Worlds_13
36,"I saw an abandoned boat, very small and remote, drifting down-stream;",The War of the Worlds_13
36,"and throwing off the most of my sodden clothes, I went after it, gained",The War of the Worlds_13
36,"it, and so escaped out of that destruction. There were no oars in the",The War of the Worlds_13
36,"boat, but I contrived to paddle, as well as my parboiled hands would",The War of the Worlds_13
36,"allow, down the river towards Halliford and Walton, going very",The War of the Worlds_13
36,"tediously and continually looking behind me, as you may well",The War of the Worlds_13
36,"understand. I followed the river, because I considered that the water",The War of the Worlds_13
36,gave me my best chance of escape should these giants return.,The War of the Worlds_13
36,,The War of the Worlds_13
36,"The hot water from the Martian’s overthrow drifted downstream with me,",The War of the Worlds_13
36,so that for the best part of a mile I could see little of either bank.,The War of the Worlds_13
36,"Once, however, I made out a string of black figures hurrying across the",The War of the Worlds_13
36,"meadows from the direction of Weybridge. Halliford, it seemed, was",The War of the Worlds_13
36,"deserted, and several of the houses facing the river were on fire. It",The War of the Worlds_13
36,"was strange to see the place quite tranquil, quite desolate under the",The War of the Worlds_13
36,"hot blue sky, with the smoke and little threads of flame going straight",The War of the Worlds_13
36,up into the heat of the afternoon. Never before had I seen houses,The War of the Worlds_13
36,burning without the accompaniment of an obstructive crowd. A little,The War of the Worlds_13
36,"farther on the dry reeds up the bank were smoking and glowing, and a",The War of the Worlds_13
36,line of fire inland was marching steadily across a late field of hay.,The War of the Worlds_13
36,,The War of the Worlds_13
36,"For a long time I drifted, so painful and weary was I after the",The War of the Worlds_13
36,"violence I had been through, and so intense the heat upon the water.",The War of the Worlds_13
36,"Then my fears got the better of me again, and I resumed my paddling.",The War of the Worlds_13
36,"The sun scorched my bare back. At last, as the bridge at Walton was",The War of the Worlds_13
36,"coming into sight round the bend, my fever and faintness overcame my",The War of the Worlds_13
36,"fears, and I landed on the Middlesex bank and lay down, deadly sick,",The War of the Worlds_13
36,amid the long grass. I suppose the time was then about four or five,The War of the Worlds_13
36,"o’clock. I got up presently, walked perhaps half a mile without meeting",The War of the Worlds_13
36,"a soul, and then lay down again in the shadow of a hedge. I seem to",The War of the Worlds_13
36,"remember talking, wanderingly, to myself during that last spurt. I was",The War of the Worlds_13
36,"also very thirsty, and bitterly regretful I had drunk no more water. It",The War of the Worlds_13
36,is a curious thing that I felt angry with my wife; I cannot account for,The War of the Worlds_13
36,"it, but my impotent desire to reach Leatherhead worried me excessively.",The War of the Worlds_13
36,,The War of the Worlds_13
36,"I do not clearly remember the arrival of the curate, so that probably I",The War of the Worlds_13
36,dozed. I became aware of him as a seated figure in soot-smudged shirt,The War of the Worlds_13
36,"sleeves, and with his upturned, clean-shaven face staring at a faint",The War of the Worlds_13
36,flickering that danced over the sky. The sky was what is called a,The War of the Worlds_13
36,"mackerel sky—rows and rows of faint down-plumes of cloud, just tinted",The War of the Worlds_13
36,with the midsummer sunset.,The War of the Worlds_13
36,,The War of the Worlds_13
36,"I sat up, and at the rustle of my motion he looked at me quickly.",The War of the Worlds_13
36,,The War of the Worlds_13
36,“Have you any water?” I asked abruptly.,The War of the Worlds_13
36,,The War of the Worlds_13
36,He shook his head.,The War of the Worlds_13
36,,The War of the Worlds_13
36,"“You have been asking for water for the last hour,” he said.",The War of the Worlds_13
36,,The War of the Worlds_13
36,"For a moment we were silent, taking stock of each other. I dare say he",The War of the Worlds_13
36,"found me a strange enough figure, naked, save for my water-soaked",The War of the Worlds_13
36,"trousers and socks, scalded, and my face and shoulders blackened by the",The War of the Worlds_13
36,"smoke. His face was a fair weakness, his chin retreated, and his hair",The War of the Worlds_13
36,"lay in crisp, almost flaxen curls on his low forehead; his eyes were",The War of the Worlds_13
36,"rather large, pale blue, and blankly staring. He spoke abruptly,",The War of the Worlds_13
36,looking vacantly away from me.,The War of the Worlds_13
36,,The War of the Worlds_13
36,“What does it mean?” he said. “What do these things mean?”,The War of the Worlds_13
36,,The War of the Worlds_13
36,I stared at him and made no answer.,The War of the Worlds_13
36,,The War of the Worlds_13
36,He extended a thin white hand and spoke in almost a complaining tone.,The War of the Worlds_13
36,,The War of the Worlds_13
36,“Why are these things permitted? What sins have we done? The morning,The War of the Worlds_13
36,"service was over, I was walking through the roads to clear my brain for",The War of the Worlds_13
36,"the afternoon, and then—fire, earthquake, death! As if it were Sodom",The War of the Worlds_13
36,"and Gomorrah! All our work undone, all the work—— What are these",The War of the Worlds_13
36,Martians?”,The War of the Worlds_13
36,,The War of the Worlds_13
36,"“What are we?” I answered, clearing my throat.",The War of the Worlds_13
36,,The War of the Worlds_13
36,"He gripped his knees and turned to look at me again. For half a minute,",The War of the Worlds_13
36,"perhaps, he stared silently.",The War of the Worlds_13
36,,The War of the Worlds_13
36,"“I was walking through the roads to clear my brain,” he said. “And",The War of the Worlds_13
36,"suddenly—fire, earthquake, death!”",The War of the Worlds_13
36,,The War of the Worlds_13
36,"He relapsed into silence, with his chin now sunken almost to his knees.",The War of the Worlds_13
36,,The War of the Worlds_13
36,Presently he began waving his hand.,The War of the Worlds_13
36,,The War of the Worlds_13
36,“All the work—all the Sunday schools—What have we done—what has,The War of the Worlds_13
36,Weybridge done? Everything gone—everything destroyed. The church! We,The War of the Worlds_13
36,rebuilt it only three years ago. Gone! Swept out of existence! Why?”,The War of the Worlds_13
36,,The War of the Worlds_13
36,"Another pause, and he broke out again like one demented.",The War of the Worlds_13
36,,The War of the Worlds_13
36,“The smoke of her burning goeth up for ever and ever!” he shouted.,The War of the Worlds_13
36,,The War of the Worlds_13
36,"His eyes flamed, and he pointed a lean finger in the direction of",The War of the Worlds_13
36,Weybridge.,The War of the Worlds_13
36,,The War of the Worlds_13
36,By this time I was beginning to take his measure. The tremendous,The War of the Worlds_13
36,tragedy in which he had been involved—it was evident he was a fugitive,The War of the Worlds_13
36,from Weybridge—had driven him to the very verge of his reason.,The War of the Worlds_13
36,,The War of the Worlds_13
36,"“Are we far from Sunbury?” I said, in a matter-of-fact tone.",The War of the Worlds_13
36,,The War of the Worlds_13
36,“What are we to do?” he asked. “Are these creatures everywhere? Has the,The War of the Worlds_13
36,earth been given over to them?”,The War of the Worlds_13
36,,The War of the Worlds_13
36,“Are we far from Sunbury?”,The War of the Worlds_13
36,,The War of the Worlds_13
36,“Only this morning I officiated at early celebration——”,The War of the Worlds_13
36,,The War of the Worlds_13
36,"“Things have changed,” I said, quietly. “You must keep your head. There",The War of the Worlds_13
36,is still hope.”,The War of the Worlds_13
36,,The War of the Worlds_13
36,“Hope!”,The War of the Worlds_13
36,,The War of the Worlds_13
36,“Yes. Plentiful hope—for all this destruction!”,The War of the Worlds_13
36,,The War of the Worlds_13
36,"I began to explain my view of our position. He listened at first, but",The War of the Worlds_13
36,as I went on the interest dawning in his eyes gave place to their,The War of the Worlds_13
36,"former stare, and his regard wandered from me.",The War of the Worlds_13
36,,The War of the Worlds_13
36,"“This must be the beginning of the end,” he said, interrupting me. “The",The War of the Worlds_13
36,end! The great and terrible day of the Lord! When men shall call upon,The War of the Worlds_13
36,the mountains and the rocks to fall upon them and hide them—hide them,The War of the Worlds_13
36,from the face of Him that sitteth upon the throne!”,The War of the Worlds_13
36,,The War of the Worlds_13
36,"I began to understand the position. I ceased my laboured reasoning,",The War of the Worlds_13
36,"struggled to my feet, and, standing over him, laid my hand on his",The War of the Worlds_13
36,shoulder.,The War of the Worlds_13
36,,The War of the Worlds_13
36,“Be a man!” said I. “You are scared out of your wits! What good is,The War of the Worlds_13
36,religion if it collapses under calamity? Think of what earthquakes and,The War of the Worlds_13
36,"floods, wars and volcanoes, have done before to men! Did you think God",The War of the Worlds_13
36,had exempted Weybridge? He is not an insurance agent.”,The War of the Worlds_13
36,,The War of the Worlds_13
36,For a time he sat in blank silence.,The War of the Worlds_13
36,,The War of the Worlds_13
36,"“But how can we escape?” he asked, suddenly. “They are invulnerable,",The War of the Worlds_13
36,they are pitiless.”,The War of the Worlds_13
36,,The War of the Worlds_13
36,"“Neither the one nor, perhaps, the other,” I answered. “And the",The War of the Worlds_13
36,mightier they are the more sane and wary should we be. One of them was,The War of the Worlds_13
36,killed yonder not three hours ago.”,The War of the Worlds_13
36,,The War of the Worlds_13
36,"“Killed!” he said, staring about him. “How can God’s ministers be",The War of the Worlds_13
36,killed?”,The War of the Worlds_13
36,,The War of the Worlds_13
36,“I saw it happen.” I proceeded to tell him. “We have chanced to come in,The War of the Worlds_13
36,"for the thick of it,” said I, “and that is all.”",The War of the Worlds_13
36,,The War of the Worlds_13
36,“What is that flicker in the sky?” he asked abruptly.,The War of the Worlds_13
36,,The War of the Worlds_13
36,I told him it was the heliograph signalling—that it was the sign of,The War of the Worlds_13
36,human help and effort in the sky.,The War of the Worlds_13
36,,The War of the Worlds_13
36,"“We are in the midst of it,” I said, “quiet as it is. That flicker in",The War of the Worlds_13
36,"the sky tells of the gathering storm. Yonder, I take it are the",The War of the Worlds_13
36,"Martians, and Londonward, where those hills rise about Richmond and",The War of the Worlds_13
36,"Kingston and the trees give cover, earthworks are being thrown up and",The War of the Worlds_13
36,guns are being placed. Presently the Martians will be coming this way,The War of the Worlds_13
36,again.”,The War of the Worlds_13
36,,The War of the Worlds_13
36,And even as I spoke he sprang to his feet and stopped me by a gesture.,The War of the Worlds_13
36,,The War of the Worlds_13
36,“Listen!” he said.,The War of the Worlds_13
36,,The War of the Worlds_13
36,From beyond the low hills across the water came the dull resonance of,The War of the Worlds_13
36,distant guns and a remote weird crying. Then everything was still. A,The War of the Worlds_13
36,cockchafer came droning over the hedge and past us. High in the west,The War of the Worlds_13
36,the crescent moon hung faint and pale above the smoke of Weybridge and,The War of the Worlds_13
36,"Shepperton and the hot, still splendour of the sunset.",The War of the Worlds_13
36,,The War of the Worlds_13
36,"“We had better follow this path,” I said, “northward.”",The War of the Worlds_13

36,,The War of the Worlds_13
36,,The War of the Worlds_13
36,XIV.,The War of the Worlds_14
36,IN LONDON.,The War of the Worlds_14
36,,The War of the Worlds_14
36,,The War of the Worlds_14
36,My younger brother was in London when the Martians fell at Woking. He,The War of the Worlds_14
36,"was a medical student working for an imminent examination, and he heard",The War of the Worlds_14
36,nothing of the arrival until Saturday morning. The morning papers on,The War of the Worlds_14
36,"Saturday contained, in addition to lengthy special articles on the",The War of the Worlds_14
36,"planet Mars, on life in the planets, and so forth, a brief and vaguely",The War of the Worlds_14
36,"worded telegram, all the more striking for its brevity.",The War of the Worlds_14
36,,The War of the Worlds_14
36,"The Martians, alarmed by the approach of a crowd, had killed a number",The War of the Worlds_14
36,"of people with a quick-firing gun, so the story ran. The telegram",The War of the Worlds_14
36,"concluded with the words: “Formidable as they seem to be, the Martians",The War of the Worlds_14
36,"have not moved from the pit into which they have fallen, and, indeed,",The War of the Worlds_14
36,seem incapable of doing so. Probably this is due to the relative,The War of the Worlds_14
36,strength of the earth’s gravitational energy.” On that last text their,The War of the Worlds_14
36,leader-writer expanded very comfortingly.,The War of the Worlds_14
36,,The War of the Worlds_14
36,"Of course all the students in the crammer’s biology class, to which my",The War of the Worlds_14
36,"brother went that day, were intensely interested, but there were no",The War of the Worlds_14
36,signs of any unusual excitement in the streets. The afternoon papers,The War of the Worlds_14
36,puffed scraps of news under big headlines. They had nothing to tell,The War of the Worlds_14
36,"beyond the movements of troops about the common, and the burning of the",The War of the Worlds_14
36,"pine woods between Woking and Weybridge, until eight. Then the _St.",The War of the Worlds_14
36,"James’s Gazette_, in an extra-special edition, announced the bare fact",The War of the Worlds_14
36,of the interruption of telegraphic communication. This was thought to,The War of the Worlds_14
36,be due to the falling of burning pine trees across the line. Nothing,The War of the Worlds_14
36,"more of the fighting was known that night, the night of my drive to",The War of the Worlds_14
36,Leatherhead and back.,The War of the Worlds_14
36,,The War of the Worlds_14
36,"My brother felt no anxiety about us, as he knew from the description in",The War of the Worlds_14
36,the papers that the cylinder was a good two miles from my house. He,The War of the Worlds_14
36,"made up his mind to run down that night to me, in order, as he says, to",The War of the Worlds_14
36,"see the Things before they were killed. He dispatched a telegram, which",The War of the Worlds_14
36,"never reached me, about four o’clock, and spent the evening at a music",The War of the Worlds_14
36,hall.,The War of the Worlds_14
36,,The War of the Worlds_14
36,"In London, also, on Saturday night there was a thunderstorm, and my",The War of the Worlds_14
36,brother reached Waterloo in a cab. On the platform from which the,The War of the Worlds_14
36,"midnight train usually starts he learned, after some waiting, that an",The War of the Worlds_14
36,accident prevented trains from reaching Woking that night. The nature,The War of the Worlds_14
36,"of the accident he could not ascertain; indeed, the railway authorities",The War of the Worlds_14
36,did not clearly know at that time. There was very little excitement in,The War of the Worlds_14
36,"the station, as the officials, failing to realise that anything further",The War of the Worlds_14
36,"than a breakdown between Byfleet and Woking junction had occurred, were",The War of the Worlds_14
36,running the theatre trains which usually passed through Woking round by,The War of the Worlds_14
36,Virginia Water or Guildford. They were busy making the necessary,The War of the Worlds_14
36,arrangements to alter the route of the Southampton and Portsmouth,The War of the Worlds_14
36,"Sunday League excursions. A nocturnal newspaper reporter, mistaking my",The War of the Worlds_14
36,"brother for the traffic manager, to whom he bears a slight resemblance,",The War of the Worlds_14
36,"waylaid and tried to interview him. Few people, excepting the railway",The War of the Worlds_14
36,"officials, connected the breakdown with the Martians.",The War of the Worlds_14
36,,The War of the Worlds_14
36,"I have read, in another account of these events, that on Sunday morning",The War of the Worlds_14
36,“all London was electrified by the news from Woking.” As a matter of,The War of the Worlds_14
36,"fact, there was nothing to justify that very extravagant phrase. Plenty",The War of the Worlds_14
36,of Londoners did not hear of the Martians until the panic of Monday,The War of the Worlds_14
36,morning. Those who did took some time to realise all that the hastily,The War of the Worlds_14
36,worded telegrams in the Sunday papers conveyed. The majority of people,The War of the Worlds_14
36,in London do not read Sunday papers.,The War of the Worlds_14
36,,The War of the Worlds_14
36,"The habit of personal security, moreover, is so deeply fixed in the",The War of the Worlds_14
36,"Londoner’s mind, and startling intelligence so much a matter of course",The War of the Worlds_14
36,"in the papers, that they could read without any personal tremors:",The War of the Worlds_14
36,"“About seven o’clock last night the Martians came out of the cylinder,",The War of the Worlds_14
36,"and, moving about under an armour of metallic shields, have completely",The War of the Worlds_14
36,"wrecked Woking station with the adjacent houses, and massacred an",The War of the Worlds_14
36,entire battalion of the Cardigan Regiment. No details are known. Maxims,The War of the Worlds_14
36,have been absolutely useless against their armour; the field guns have,The War of the Worlds_14
36,been disabled by them. Flying hussars have been galloping into,The War of the Worlds_14
36,Chertsey. The Martians appear to be moving slowly towards Chertsey or,The War of the Worlds_14
36,"Windsor. Great anxiety prevails in West Surrey, and earthworks are",The War of the Worlds_14
36,being thrown up to check the advance Londonward.” That was how the,The War of the Worlds_14
36,"_Sunday Sun_ put it, and a clever and remarkably prompt “handbook”",The War of the Worlds_14
36,article in the _Referee_ compared the affair to a menagerie suddenly,The War of the Worlds_14
36,let loose in a village.,The War of the Worlds_14
36,,The War of the Worlds_14
36,No one in London knew positively of the nature of the armoured,The War of the Worlds_14
36,"Martians, and there was still a fixed idea that these monsters must be",The War of the Worlds_14
36,"sluggish: “crawling,” “creeping painfully”—such expressions occurred in",The War of the Worlds_14
36,almost all the earlier reports. None of the telegrams could have been,The War of the Worlds_14
36,written by an eyewitness of their advance. The Sunday papers printed,The War of the Worlds_14
36,"separate editions as further news came to hand, some even in default of",The War of the Worlds_14
36,it. But there was practically nothing more to tell people until late in,The War of the Worlds_14
36,"the afternoon, when the authorities gave the press agencies the news in",The War of the Worlds_14
36,their possession. It was stated that the people of Walton and,The War of the Worlds_14
36,"Weybridge, and all the district were pouring along the roads",The War of the Worlds_14
36,"Londonward, and that was all.",The War of the Worlds_14
36,,The War of the Worlds_14
36,"My brother went to church at the Foundling Hospital in the morning,",The War of the Worlds_14
36,still in ignorance of what had happened on the previous night. There he,The War of the Worlds_14
36,"heard allusions made to the invasion, and a special prayer for peace.",The War of the Worlds_14
36,"Coming out, he bought a _Referee_. He became alarmed at the news in",The War of the Worlds_14
36,"this, and went again to Waterloo station to find out if communication",The War of the Worlds_14
36,"were restored. The omnibuses, carriages, cyclists, and innumerable",The War of the Worlds_14
36,people walking in their best clothes seemed scarcely affected by the,The War of the Worlds_14
36,strange intelligence that the newsvendors were disseminating. People,The War of the Worlds_14
36,"were interested, or, if alarmed, alarmed only on account of the local",The War of the Worlds_14
36,residents. At the station he heard for the first time that the Windsor,The War of the Worlds_14
36,and Chertsey lines were now interrupted. The porters told him that,The War of the Worlds_14
36,several remarkable telegrams had been received in the morning from,The War of the Worlds_14
36,"Byfleet and Chertsey stations, but that these had abruptly ceased. My",The War of the Worlds_14
36,brother could get very little precise detail out of them.,The War of the Worlds_14
36,,The War of the Worlds_14
36,“There’s fighting going on about Weybridge” was the extent of their,The War of the Worlds_14
36,information.,The War of the Worlds_14
36,,The War of the Worlds_14
36,The train service was now very much disorganised. Quite a number of,The War of the Worlds_14
36,people who had been expecting friends from places on the South-Western,The War of the Worlds_14
36,network were standing about the station. One grey-headed old gentleman,The War of the Worlds_14
36,came and abused the South-Western Company bitterly to my brother. “It,The War of the Worlds_14
36,"wants showing up,” he said.",The War of the Worlds_14
36,,The War of the Worlds_14
36,"One or two trains came in from Richmond, Putney, and Kingston,",The War of the Worlds_14
36,containing people who had gone out for a day’s boating and found the,The War of the Worlds_14
36,locks closed and a feeling of panic in the air. A man in a blue and,The War of the Worlds_14
36,"white blazer addressed my brother, full of strange tidings.",The War of the Worlds_14
36,,The War of the Worlds_14
36,“There’s hosts of people driving into Kingston in traps and carts and,The War of the Worlds_14
36,"things, with boxes of valuables and all that,” he said. “They come from",The War of the Worlds_14
36,"Molesey and Weybridge and Walton, and they say there’s been guns heard",The War of the Worlds_14
36,"at Chertsey, heavy firing, and that mounted soldiers have told them to",The War of the Worlds_14
36,get off at once because the Martians are coming. We heard guns firing,The War of the Worlds_14
36,"at Hampton Court station, but we thought it was thunder. What the",The War of the Worlds_14
36,"dickens does it all mean? The Martians can’t get out of their pit, can",The War of the Worlds_14
36,they?”,The War of the Worlds_14
36,,The War of the Worlds_14
36,My brother could not tell him.,The War of the Worlds_14
36,,The War of the Worlds_14
36,Afterwards he found that the vague feeling of alarm had spread to the,The War of the Worlds_14
36,"clients of the underground railway, and that the Sunday excursionists",The War of the Worlds_14
36,"began to return from all over the South-Western “lung”—Barnes,",The War of the Worlds_14
36,"Wimbledon, Richmond Park, Kew, and so forth—at unnaturally early hours;",The War of the Worlds_14
36,but not a soul had anything more than vague hearsay to tell of.,The War of the Worlds_14
36,Everyone connected with the terminus seemed ill-tempered.,The War of the Worlds_14
36,,The War of the Worlds_14
36,About five o’clock the gathering crowd in the station was immensely,The War of the Worlds_14
36,"excited by the opening of the line of communication, which is almost",The War of the Worlds_14
36,"invariably closed, between the South-Eastern and the South-Western",The War of the Worlds_14
36,"stations, and the passage of carriage trucks bearing huge guns and",The War of the Worlds_14
36,carriages crammed with soldiers. These were the guns that were brought,The War of the Worlds_14
36,up from Woolwich and Chatham to cover Kingston. There was an exchange,The War of the Worlds_14
36,of pleasantries: “You’ll get eaten!” “We’re the beast-tamers!” and so,The War of the Worlds_14
36,forth. A little while after that a squad of police came into the,The War of the Worlds_14
36,"station and began to clear the public off the platforms, and my brother",The War of the Worlds_14
36,went out into the street again.,The War of the Worlds_14
36,,The War of the Worlds_14
36,"The church bells were ringing for evensong, and a squad of Salvation",The War of the Worlds_14
36,Army lassies came singing down Waterloo Road. On the bridge a number of,The War of the Worlds_14
36,loafers were watching a curious brown scum that came drifting down the,The War of the Worlds_14
36,"stream in patches. The sun was just setting, and the Clock Tower and",The War of the Worlds_14
36,the Houses of Parliament rose against one of the most peaceful skies it,The War of the Worlds_14
36,"is possible to imagine, a sky of gold, barred with long transverse",The War of the Worlds_14
36,stripes of reddish-purple cloud. There was talk of a floating body. One,The War of the Worlds_14
36,"of the men there, a reservist he said he was, told my brother he had",The War of the Worlds_14
36,seen the heliograph flickering in the west.,The War of the Worlds_14
36,,The War of the Worlds_14
36,In Wellington Street my brother met a couple of sturdy roughs who had,The War of the Worlds_14
36,just been rushed out of Fleet Street with still-wet newspapers and,The War of the Worlds_14
36,staring placards. “Dreadful catastrophe!” they bawled one to the other,The War of the Worlds_14
36,down Wellington Street. “Fighting at Weybridge! Full description!,The War of the Worlds_14
36,Repulse of the Martians! London in Danger!” He had to give threepence,The War of the Worlds_14
36,for a copy of that paper.,The War of the Worlds_14
36,,The War of the Worlds_14
36,"Then it was, and then only, that he realised something of the full",The War of the Worlds_14
36,power and terror of these monsters. He learned that they were not,The War of the Worlds_14
36,"merely a handful of small sluggish creatures, but that they were minds",The War of the Worlds_14
36,swaying vast mechanical bodies; and that they could move swiftly and,The War of the Worlds_14
36,smite with such power that even the mightiest guns could not stand,The War of the Worlds_14
36,against them.,The War of the Worlds_14
36,,The War of the Worlds_14
36,"They were described as “vast spiderlike machines, nearly a hundred feet",The War of the Worlds_14
36,"high, capable of the speed of an express train, and able to shoot out a",The War of the Worlds_14
36,"beam of intense heat.” Masked batteries, chiefly of field guns, had",The War of the Worlds_14
36,"been planted in the country about Horsell Common, and especially",The War of the Worlds_14
36,between the Woking district and London. Five of the machines had been,The War of the Worlds_14
36,"seen moving towards the Thames, and one, by a happy chance, had been",The War of the Worlds_14
36,"destroyed. In the other cases the shells had missed, and the batteries",The War of the Worlds_14
36,had been at once annihilated by the Heat-Rays. Heavy losses of soldiers,The War of the Worlds_14
36,"were mentioned, but the tone of the dispatch was optimistic.",The War of the Worlds_14
36,,The War of the Worlds_14
36,The Martians had been repulsed; they were not invulnerable. They had,The War of the Worlds_14
36,"retreated to their triangle of cylinders again, in the circle about",The War of the Worlds_14
36,Woking. Signallers with heliographs were pushing forward upon them from,The War of the Worlds_14
36,"all sides. Guns were in rapid transit from Windsor, Portsmouth,",The War of the Worlds_14
36,"Aldershot, Woolwich—even from the north; among others, long wire-guns",The War of the Worlds_14
36,of ninety-five tons from Woolwich. Altogether one hundred and sixteen,The War of the Worlds_14
36,"were in position or being hastily placed, chiefly covering London.",The War of the Worlds_14
36,Never before in England had there been such a vast or rapid,The War of the Worlds_14
36,concentration of military material.,The War of the Worlds_14
36,,The War of the Worlds_14
36,"Any further cylinders that fell, it was hoped, could be destroyed at",The War of the Worlds_14
36,"once by high explosives, which were being rapidly manufactured and",The War of the Worlds_14
36,"distributed. No doubt, ran the report, the situation was of the",The War of the Worlds_14
36,"strangest and gravest description, but the public was exhorted to avoid",The War of the Worlds_14
36,and discourage panic. No doubt the Martians were strange and terrible,The War of the Worlds_14
36,"in the extreme, but at the outside there could not be more than twenty",The War of the Worlds_14
36,of them against our millions.,The War of the Worlds_14
36,,The War of the Worlds_14
36,"The authorities had reason to suppose, from the size of the cylinders,",The War of the Worlds_14
36,that at the outside there could not be more than five in each,The War of the Worlds_14
36,cylinder—fifteen altogether. And one at least was disposed of—perhaps,The War of the Worlds_14
36,"more. The public would be fairly warned of the approach of danger, and",The War of the Worlds_14
36,elaborate measures were being taken for the protection of the people in,The War of the Worlds_14
36,"the threatened southwestern suburbs. And so, with reiterated assurances",The War of the Worlds_14
36,of the safety of London and the ability of the authorities to cope with,The War of the Worlds_14
36,"the difficulty, this quasi-proclamation closed.",The War of the Worlds_14
36,,The War of the Worlds_14
36,This was printed in enormous type on paper so fresh that it was still,The War of the Worlds_14
36,"wet, and there had been no time to add a word of comment. It was",The War of the Worlds_14
36,"curious, my brother said, to see how ruthlessly the usual contents of",The War of the Worlds_14
36,the paper had been hacked and taken out to give this place.,The War of the Worlds_14
36,,The War of the Worlds_14
36,All down Wellington Street people could be seen fluttering out the pink,The War of the Worlds_14
36,"sheets and reading, and the Strand was suddenly noisy with the voices",The War of the Worlds_14
36,of an army of hawkers following these pioneers. Men came scrambling off,The War of the Worlds_14
36,"buses to secure copies. Certainly this news excited people intensely,",The War of the Worlds_14
36,whatever their previous apathy. The shutters of a map shop in the,The War of the Worlds_14
36,"Strand were being taken down, my brother said, and a man in his Sunday",The War of the Worlds_14
36,"raiment, lemon-yellow gloves even, was visible inside the window",The War of the Worlds_14
36,hastily fastening maps of Surrey to the glass.,The War of the Worlds_14
36,,The War of the Worlds_14
36,"Going on along the Strand to Trafalgar Square, the paper in his hand,",The War of the Worlds_14
36,my brother saw some of the fugitives from West Surrey. There was a man,The War of the Worlds_14
36,with his wife and two boys and some articles of furniture in a cart,The War of the Worlds_14
36,such as greengrocers use. He was driving from the direction of,The War of the Worlds_14
36,Westminster Bridge; and close behind him came a hay waggon with five or,The War of the Worlds_14
36,"six respectable-looking people in it, and some boxes and bundles. The",The War of the Worlds_14
36,"faces of these people were haggard, and their entire appearance",The War of the Worlds_14
36,contrasted conspicuously with the Sabbath-best appearance of the people,The War of the Worlds_14
36,on the omnibuses. People in fashionable clothing peeped at them out of,The War of the Worlds_14
36,"cabs. They stopped at the Square as if undecided which way to take, and",The War of the Worlds_14
36,finally turned eastward along the Strand. Some way behind these came a,The War of the Worlds_14
36,"man in workday clothes, riding one of those old-fashioned tricycles",The War of the Worlds_14
36,with a small front wheel. He was dirty and white in the face.,The War of the Worlds_14
36,,The War of the Worlds_14
36,"My brother turned down towards Victoria, and met a number of such",The War of the Worlds_14
36,people. He had a vague idea that he might see something of me. He,The War of the Worlds_14
36,noticed an unusual number of police regulating the traffic. Some of the,The War of the Worlds_14
36,refugees were exchanging news with the people on the omnibuses. One was,The War of the Worlds_14
36,"professing to have seen the Martians. “Boilers on stilts, I tell you,",The War of the Worlds_14
36,striding along like men.” Most of them were excited and animated by,The War of the Worlds_14
36,their strange experience.,The War of the Worlds_14
36,,The War of the Worlds_14
36,Beyond Victoria the public-houses were doing a lively trade with these,The War of the Worlds_14
36,arrivals. At all the street corners groups of people were reading,The War of the Worlds_14
36,"papers, talking excitedly, or staring at these unusual Sunday visitors.",The War of the Worlds_14
36,"They seemed to increase as night drew on, until at last the roads, my",The War of the Worlds_14
36,"brother said, were like Epsom High Street on a Derby Day. My brother",The War of the Worlds_14
36,addressed several of these fugitives and got unsatisfactory answers,The War of the Worlds_14
36,from most.,The War of the Worlds_14
36,,The War of the Worlds_14
36,"None of them could tell him any news of Woking except one man, who",The War of the Worlds_14
36,assured him that Woking had been entirely destroyed on the previous,The War of the Worlds_14
36,night.,The War of the Worlds_14
36,,The War of the Worlds_14
36,"“I come from Byfleet,” he said; “a man on a bicycle came through the",The War of the Worlds_14
36,"place in the early morning, and ran from door to door warning us to",The War of the Worlds_14
36,"come away. Then came soldiers. We went out to look, and there were",The War of the Worlds_14
36,"clouds of smoke to the south—nothing but smoke, and not a soul coming",The War of the Worlds_14
36,"that way. Then we heard the guns at Chertsey, and folks coming from",The War of the Worlds_14
36,Weybridge. So I’ve locked up my house and come on.”,The War of the Worlds_14
36,,The War of the Worlds_14
36,At that time there was a strong feeling in the streets that the,The War of the Worlds_14
36,authorities were to blame for their incapacity to dispose of the,The War of the Worlds_14
36,invaders without all this inconvenience.,The War of the Worlds_14
36,,The War of the Worlds_14
36,About eight o’clock a noise of heavy firing was distinctly audible all,The War of the Worlds_14
36,over the south of London. My brother could not hear it for the traffic,The War of the Worlds_14
36,"in the main thoroughfares, but by striking through the quiet back",The War of the Worlds_14
36,streets to the river he was able to distinguish it quite plainly.,The War of the Worlds_14
36,,The War of the Worlds_14
36,"He walked from Westminster to his apartments near Regent’s Park, about",The War of the Worlds_14
36,"two. He was now very anxious on my account, and disturbed at the",The War of the Worlds_14
36,"evident magnitude of the trouble. His mind was inclined to run, even as",The War of the Worlds_14
36,"mine had run on Saturday, on military details. He thought of all those",The War of the Worlds_14
36,"silent, expectant guns, of the suddenly nomadic countryside; he tried",The War of the Worlds_14
36,to imagine “boilers on stilts” a hundred feet high.,The War of the Worlds_14
36,,The War of the Worlds_14
36,There were one or two cartloads of refugees passing along Oxford,The War of the Worlds_14
36,"Street, and several in the Marylebone Road, but so slowly was the news",The War of the Worlds_14
36,spreading that Regent Street and Portland Place were full of their,The War of the Worlds_14
36,"usual Sunday-night promenaders, albeit they talked in groups, and along",The War of the Worlds_14
36,the edge of Regent’s Park there were as many silent couples “walking,The War of the Worlds_14
36,out” together under the scattered gas lamps as ever there had been. The,The War of the Worlds_14
36,"night was warm and still, and a little oppressive; the sound of guns",The War of the Worlds_14
36,"continued intermittently, and after midnight there seemed to be sheet",The War of the Worlds_14
36,lightning in the south.,The War of the Worlds_14
36,,The War of the Worlds_14
36,"He read and re-read the paper, fearing the worst had happened to me. He",The War of the Worlds_14
36,"was restless, and after supper prowled out again aimlessly. He returned",The War of the Worlds_14
36,and tried in vain to divert his attention to his examination notes. He,The War of the Worlds_14
36,"went to bed a little after midnight, and was awakened from lurid dreams",The War of the Worlds_14
36,"in the small hours of Monday by the sound of door knockers, feet",The War of the Worlds_14
36,"running in the street, distant drumming, and a clamour of bells. Red",The War of the Worlds_14
36,"reflections danced on the ceiling. For a moment he lay astonished,",The War of the Worlds_14
36,wondering whether day had come or the world gone mad. Then he jumped,The War of the Worlds_14
36,out of bed and ran to the window.,The War of the Worlds_14
36,,The War of the Worlds_14
36,"His room was an attic and as he thrust his head out, up and down the",The War of the Worlds_14
36,"street there were a dozen echoes to the noise of his window sash, and",The War of the Worlds_14
36,heads in every kind of night disarray appeared. Enquiries were being,The War of the Worlds_14
36,"shouted. “They are coming!” bawled a policeman, hammering at the door;",The War of the Worlds_14
36,“the Martians are coming!” and hurried to the next door.,The War of the Worlds_14
36,,The War of the Worlds_14
36,The sound of drumming and trumpeting came from the Albany Street,The War of the Worlds_14
36,"Barracks, and every church within earshot was hard at work killing",The War of the Worlds_14
36,sleep with a vehement disorderly tocsin. There was a noise of doors,The War of the Worlds_14
36,"opening, and window after window in the houses opposite flashed from",The War of the Worlds_14
36,darkness into yellow illumination.,The War of the Worlds_14
36,,The War of the Worlds_14
36,"Up the street came galloping a closed carriage, bursting abruptly into",The War of the Worlds_14
36,"noise at the corner, rising to a clattering climax under the window,",The War of the Worlds_14
36,and dying away slowly in the distance. Close on the rear of this came a,The War of the Worlds_14
36,"couple of cabs, the forerunners of a long procession of flying",The War of the Worlds_14
36,"vehicles, going for the most part to Chalk Farm station, where the",The War of the Worlds_14
36,"North-Western special trains were loading up, instead of coming down",The War of the Worlds_14
36,the gradient into Euston.,The War of the Worlds_14
36,,The War of the Worlds_14
36,For a long time my brother stared out of the window in blank,The War of the Worlds_14
36,"astonishment, watching the policemen hammering at door after door, and",The War of the Worlds_14
36,delivering their incomprehensible message. Then the door behind him,The War of the Worlds_14
36,"opened, and the man who lodged across the landing came in, dressed only",The War of the Worlds_14
36,"in shirt, trousers, and slippers, his braces loose about his waist, his",The War of the Worlds_14
36,hair disordered from his pillow.,The War of the Worlds_14
36,,The War of the Worlds_14
36,“What the devil is it?” he asked. “A fire? What a devil of a row!”,The War of the Worlds_14
36,,The War of the Worlds_14
36,"They both craned their heads out of the window, straining to hear what",The War of the Worlds_14
36,the policemen were shouting. People were coming out of the side,The War of the Worlds_14
36,"streets, and standing in groups at the corners talking.",The War of the Worlds_14
36,,The War of the Worlds_14
36,“What the devil is it all about?” said my brother’s fellow lodger.,The War of the Worlds_14
36,,The War of the Worlds_14
36,"My brother answered him vaguely and began to dress, running with each",The War of the Worlds_14
36,garment to the window in order to miss nothing of the growing,The War of the Worlds_14
36,excitement. And presently men selling unnaturally early newspapers came,The War of the Worlds_14
36,bawling into the street:,The War of the Worlds_14
36,,The War of the Worlds_14
36,“London in danger of suffocation! The Kingston and Richmond defences,The War of the Worlds_14
36,forced! Fearful massacres in the Thames Valley!”,The War of the Worlds_14
36,,The War of the Worlds_14
36,"And all about him—in the rooms below, in the houses on each side and",The War of the Worlds_14
36,"across the road, and behind in the Park Terraces and in the hundred",The War of the Worlds_14
36,"other streets of that part of Marylebone, and the Westbourne Park",The War of the Worlds_14
36,"district and St. Pancras, and westward and northward in Kilburn and St.",The War of the Worlds_14
36,"John’s Wood and Hampstead, and eastward in Shoreditch and Highbury and",The War of the Worlds_14
36,"Haggerston and Hoxton, and, indeed, through all the vastness of London",The War of the Worlds_14
36,"from Ealing to East Ham—people were rubbing their eyes, and opening",The War of the Worlds_14
36,"windows to stare out and ask aimless questions, dressing hastily as the",The War of the Worlds_14
36,first breath of the coming storm of Fear blew through the streets. It,The War of the Worlds_14
36,"was the dawn of the great panic. London, which had gone to bed on",The War of the Worlds_14
36,"Sunday night oblivious and inert, was awakened, in the small hours of",The War of the Worlds_14
36,"Monday morning, to a vivid sense of danger.",The War of the Worlds_14
36,,The War of the Worlds_14
36,"Unable from his window to learn what was happening, my brother went",The War of the Worlds_14
36,"down and out into the street, just as the sky between the parapets of",The War of the Worlds_14
36,the houses grew pink with the early dawn. The flying people on foot and,The War of the Worlds_14
36,in vehicles grew more numerous every moment. “Black Smoke!” he heard,The War of the Worlds_14
36,"people crying, and again “Black Smoke!” The contagion of such a",The War of the Worlds_14
36,unanimous fear was inevitable. As my brother hesitated on the,The War of the Worlds_14
36,"door-step, he saw another newsvendor approaching, and got a paper",The War of the Worlds_14
36,"forthwith. The man was running away with the rest, and selling his",The War of the Worlds_14
36,papers for a shilling each as he ran—a grotesque mingling of profit and,The War of the Worlds_14
36,panic.,The War of the Worlds_14
36,,The War of the Worlds_14
36,And from this paper my brother read that catastrophic dispatch of the,The War of the Worlds_14
36,Commander-in-Chief:,The War of the Worlds_14
36,,The War of the Worlds_14
36,“The Martians are able to discharge enormous clouds of a black and,The War of the Worlds_14
36,poisonous vapour by means of rockets. They have smothered our,The War of the Worlds_14
36,"batteries, destroyed Richmond, Kingston, and Wimbledon, and are",The War of the Worlds_14
36,"advancing slowly towards London, destroying everything on the way. It",The War of the Worlds_14
36,is impossible to stop them. There is no safety from the Black Smoke but,The War of the Worlds_14
36,in instant flight.”,The War of the Worlds_14
36,,The War of the Worlds_14
36,,The War of the Worlds_14
36,"That was all, but it was enough. The whole population of the great",The War of the Worlds_14
36,"six-million city was stirring, slipping, running; presently it would be",The War of the Worlds_14
36,pouring _en masse_ northward.,The War of the Worlds_14
36,,The War of the Worlds_14
36,“Black Smoke!” the voices cried. “Fire!”,The War of the Worlds_14
36,,The War of the Worlds_14
36,"The bells of the neighbouring church made a jangling tumult, a cart",The War of the Worlds_14
36,"carelessly driven smashed, amid shrieks and curses, against the water",The War of the Worlds_14
36,trough up the street. Sickly yellow lights went to and fro in the,The War of the Worlds_14
36,"houses, and some of the passing cabs flaunted unextinguished lamps. And",The War of the Worlds_14
36,"overhead the dawn was growing brighter, clear and steady and calm.",The War of the Worlds_14
36,,The War of the Worlds_14
36,"He heard footsteps running to and fro in the rooms, and up and down",The War of the Worlds_14
36,"stairs behind him. His landlady came to the door, loosely wrapped in",The War of the Worlds_14
36,"dressing gown and shawl; her husband followed, ejaculating.",The War of the Worlds_14
36,,The War of the Worlds_14
36,"As my brother began to realise the import of all these things, he",The War of the Worlds_14
36,"turned hastily to his own room, put all his available money—some ten",The War of the Worlds_14
36,"pounds altogether—into his pockets, and went out again into the",The War of the Worlds_14
36,streets.,The War of the Worlds_14

36,XV.,The War of the Worlds_15
36,WHAT HAD HAPPENED IN SURREY.,The War of the Worlds_15
36,,The War of the Worlds_15
36,,The War of the Worlds_15
36,It was while the curate had sat and talked so wildly to me under the,The War of the Worlds_15
36,"hedge in the flat meadows near Halliford, and while my brother was",The War of the Worlds_15
36,"watching the fugitives stream over Westminster Bridge, that the",The War of the Worlds_15
36,Martians had resumed the offensive. So far as one can ascertain from,The War of the Worlds_15
36,"the conflicting accounts that have been put forth, the majority of them",The War of the Worlds_15
36,remained busied with preparations in the Horsell pit until nine that,The War of the Worlds_15
36,"night, hurrying on some operation that disengaged huge volumes of green",The War of the Worlds_15
36,smoke.,The War of the Worlds_15
36,,The War of the Worlds_15
36,"But three certainly came out about eight o’clock and, advancing slowly",The War of the Worlds_15
36,"and cautiously, made their way through Byfleet and Pyrford towards",The War of the Worlds_15
36,"Ripley and Weybridge, and so came in sight of the expectant batteries",The War of the Worlds_15
36,"against the setting sun. These Martians did not advance in a body, but",The War of the Worlds_15
36,"in a line, each perhaps a mile and a half from his nearest fellow. They",The War of the Worlds_15
36,"communicated with one another by means of sirenlike howls, running up",The War of the Worlds_15
36,and down the scale from one note to another.,The War of the Worlds_15
36,,The War of the Worlds_15
36,It was this howling and firing of the guns at Ripley and St. George’s,The War of the Worlds_15
36,"Hill that we had heard at Upper Halliford. The Ripley gunners,",The War of the Worlds_15
36,unseasoned artillery volunteers who ought never to have been placed in,The War of the Worlds_15
36,"such a position, fired one wild, premature, ineffectual volley, and",The War of the Worlds_15
36,"bolted on horse and foot through the deserted village, while the",The War of the Worlds_15
36,"Martian, without using his Heat-Ray, walked serenely over their guns,",The War of the Worlds_15
36,"stepped gingerly among them, passed in front of them, and so came",The War of the Worlds_15
36,"unexpectedly upon the guns in Painshill Park, which he destroyed.",The War of the Worlds_15
36,,The War of the Worlds_15
36,"The St. George’s Hill men, however, were better led or of a better",The War of the Worlds_15
36,"mettle. Hidden by a pine wood as they were, they seem to have been",The War of the Worlds_15
36,quite unsuspected by the Martian nearest to them. They laid their guns,The War of the Worlds_15
36,"as deliberately as if they had been on parade, and fired at about a",The War of the Worlds_15
36,thousand yards’ range.,The War of the Worlds_15
36,,The War of the Worlds_15
36,"The shells flashed all round him, and he was seen to advance a few",The War of the Worlds_15
36,"paces, stagger, and go down. Everybody yelled together, and the guns",The War of the Worlds_15
36,were reloaded in frantic haste. The overthrown Martian set up a,The War of the Worlds_15
36,"prolonged ululation, and immediately a second glittering giant,",The War of the Worlds_15
36,"answering him, appeared over the trees to the south. It would seem that",The War of the Worlds_15
36,a leg of the tripod had been smashed by one of the shells. The whole of,The War of the Worlds_15
36,"the second volley flew wide of the Martian on the ground, and,",The War of the Worlds_15
36,"simultaneously, both his companions brought their Heat-Rays to bear on",The War of the Worlds_15
36,"the battery. The ammunition blew up, the pine trees all about the guns",The War of the Worlds_15
36,"flashed into fire, and only one or two of the men who were already",The War of the Worlds_15
36,running over the crest of the hill escaped.,The War of the Worlds_15
36,,The War of the Worlds_15
36,After this it would seem that the three took counsel together and,The War of the Worlds_15
36,"halted, and the scouts who were watching them report that they remained",The War of the Worlds_15
36,absolutely stationary for the next half hour. The Martian who had been,The War of the Worlds_15
36,"overthrown crawled tediously out of his hood, a small brown figure,",The War of the Worlds_15
36,"oddly suggestive from that distance of a speck of blight, and",The War of the Worlds_15
36,apparently engaged in the repair of his support. About nine he had,The War of the Worlds_15
36,"finished, for his cowl was then seen above the trees again.",The War of the Worlds_15
36,,The War of the Worlds_15
36,It was a few minutes past nine that night when these three sentinels,The War of the Worlds_15
36,"were joined by four other Martians, each carrying a thick black tube. A",The War of the Worlds_15
36,"similar tube was handed to each of the three, and the seven proceeded",The War of the Worlds_15
36,to distribute themselves at equal distances along a curved line between,The War of the Worlds_15
36,"St. George’s Hill, Weybridge, and the village of Send, southwest of",The War of the Worlds_15
36,Ripley.,The War of the Worlds_15
36,,The War of the Worlds_15
36,A dozen rockets sprang out of the hills before them so soon as they,The War of the Worlds_15
36,"began to move, and warned the waiting batteries about Ditton and Esher.",The War of the Worlds_15
36,"At the same time four of their fighting machines, similarly armed with",The War of the Worlds_15
36,"tubes, crossed the river, and two of them, black against the western",The War of the Worlds_15
36,"sky, came into sight of myself and the curate as we hurried wearily and",The War of the Worlds_15
36,painfully along the road that runs northward out of Halliford. They,The War of the Worlds_15
36,"moved, as it seemed to us, upon a cloud, for a milky mist covered the",The War of the Worlds_15
36,fields and rose to a third of their height.,The War of the Worlds_15
36,,The War of the Worlds_15
36,"At this sight the curate cried faintly in his throat, and began",The War of the Worlds_15
36,"running; but I knew it was no good running from a Martian, and I turned",The War of the Worlds_15
36,aside and crawled through dewy nettles and brambles into the broad,The War of the Worlds_15
36,"ditch by the side of the road. He looked back, saw what I was doing,",The War of the Worlds_15
36,and turned to join me.,The War of the Worlds_15
36,,The War of the Worlds_15
36,"The two halted, the nearer to us standing and facing Sunbury, the",The War of the Worlds_15
36,"remoter being a grey indistinctness towards the evening star, away",The War of the Worlds_15
36,towards Staines.,The War of the Worlds_15
36,,The War of the Worlds_15
36,The occasional howling of the Martians had ceased; they took up their,The War of the Worlds_15
36,positions in the huge crescent about their cylinders in absolute,The War of the Worlds_15
36,silence. It was a crescent with twelve miles between its horns. Never,The War of the Worlds_15
36,since the devising of gunpowder was the beginning of a battle so still.,The War of the Worlds_15
36,To us and to an observer about Ripley it would have had precisely the,The War of the Worlds_15
36,same effect—the Martians seemed in solitary possession of the darkling,The War of the Worlds_15
36,"night, lit only as it was by the slender moon, the stars, the afterglow",The War of the Worlds_15
36,"of the daylight, and the ruddy glare from St. George’s Hill and the",The War of the Worlds_15
36,woods of Painshill.,The War of the Worlds_15
36,,The War of the Worlds_15
36,"But facing that crescent everywhere—at Staines, Hounslow, Ditton,",The War of the Worlds_15
36,"Esher, Ockham, behind hills and woods south of the river, and across",The War of the Worlds_15
36,"the flat grass meadows to the north of it, wherever a cluster of trees",The War of the Worlds_15
36,or village houses gave sufficient cover—the guns were waiting. The,The War of the Worlds_15
36,signal rockets burst and rained their sparks through the night and,The War of the Worlds_15
36,"vanished, and the spirit of all those watching batteries rose to a",The War of the Worlds_15
36,tense expectation. The Martians had but to advance into the line of,The War of the Worlds_15
36,"fire, and instantly those motionless black forms of men, those guns",The War of the Worlds_15
36,"glittering so darkly in the early night, would explode into a",The War of the Worlds_15
36,thunderous fury of battle.,The War of the Worlds_15
36,,The War of the Worlds_15
36,No doubt the thought that was uppermost in a thousand of those vigilant,The War of the Worlds_15
36,"minds, even as it was uppermost in mine, was the riddle—how much they",The War of the Worlds_15
36,understood of us. Did they grasp that we in our millions were,The War of the Worlds_15
36,"organized, disciplined, working together? Or did they interpret our",The War of the Worlds_15
36,"spurts of fire, the sudden stinging of our shells, our steady",The War of the Worlds_15
36,"investment of their encampment, as we should the furious unanimity of",The War of the Worlds_15
36,onslaught in a disturbed hive of bees? Did they dream they might,The War of the Worlds_15
36,exterminate us? (At that time no one knew what food they needed.) A,The War of the Worlds_15
36,hundred such questions struggled together in my mind as I watched that,The War of the Worlds_15
36,vast sentinel shape. And in the back of my mind was the sense of all,The War of the Worlds_15
36,the huge unknown and hidden forces Londonward. Had they prepared,The War of the Worlds_15
36,pitfalls? Were the powder mills at Hounslow ready as a snare? Would the,The War of the Worlds_15
36,Londoners have the heart and courage to make a greater Moscow of their,The War of the Worlds_15
36,mighty province of houses?,The War of the Worlds_15
36,,The War of the Worlds_15
36,"Then, after an interminable time, as it seemed to us, crouching and",The War of the Worlds_15
36,"peering through the hedge, came a sound like the distant concussion of",The War of the Worlds_15
36,"a gun. Another nearer, and then another. And then the Martian beside us",The War of the Worlds_15
36,"raised his tube on high and discharged it, gunwise, with a heavy report",The War of the Worlds_15
36,that made the ground heave. The one towards Staines answered him. There,The War of the Worlds_15
36,"was no flash, no smoke, simply that loaded detonation.",The War of the Worlds_15
36,,The War of the Worlds_15
36,I was so excited by these heavy minute-guns following one another that,The War of the Worlds_15
36,I so far forgot my personal safety and my scalded hands as to clamber,The War of the Worlds_15
36,up into the hedge and stare towards Sunbury. As I did so a second,The War of the Worlds_15
36,"report followed, and a big projectile hurtled overhead towards",The War of the Worlds_15
36,"Hounslow. I expected at least to see smoke or fire, or some such",The War of the Worlds_15
36,"evidence of its work. But all I saw was the deep blue sky above, with",The War of the Worlds_15
36,"one solitary star, and the white mist spreading wide and low beneath.",The War of the Worlds_15
36,"And there had been no crash, no answering explosion. The silence was",The War of the Worlds_15
36,restored; the minute lengthened to three.,The War of the Worlds_15
36,,The War of the Worlds_15
36,"“What has happened?” said the curate, standing up beside me.",The War of the Worlds_15
36,,The War of the Worlds_15
36,“Heaven knows!” said I.,The War of the Worlds_15
36,,The War of the Worlds_15
36,A bat flickered by and vanished. A distant tumult of shouting began and,The War of the Worlds_15
36,"ceased. I looked again at the Martian, and saw he was now moving",The War of the Worlds_15
36,"eastward along the riverbank, with a swift, rolling motion.",The War of the Worlds_15
36,,The War of the Worlds_15
36,Every moment I expected the fire of some hidden battery to spring upon,The War of the Worlds_15
36,him; but the evening calm was unbroken. The figure of the Martian grew,The War of the Worlds_15
36,"smaller as he receded, and presently the mist and the gathering night",The War of the Worlds_15
36,had swallowed him up. By a common impulse we clambered higher. Towards,The War of the Worlds_15
36,"Sunbury was a dark appearance, as though a conical hill had suddenly",The War of the Worlds_15
36,"come into being there, hiding our view of the farther country; and",The War of the Worlds_15
36,"then, remoter across the river, over Walton, we saw another such",The War of the Worlds_15
36,summit. These hill-like forms grew lower and broader even as we stared.,The War of the Worlds_15
36,,The War of the Worlds_15
36,"Moved by a sudden thought, I looked northward, and there I perceived a",The War of the Worlds_15
36,third of these cloudy black kopjes had risen.,The War of the Worlds_15
36,,The War of the Worlds_15
36,"Everything had suddenly become very still. Far away to the southeast,",The War of the Worlds_15
36,"marking the quiet, we heard the Martians hooting to one another, and",The War of the Worlds_15
36,then the air quivered again with the distant thud of their guns. But,The War of the Worlds_15
36,the earthly artillery made no reply.,The War of the Worlds_15
36,,The War of the Worlds_15
36,"Now at the time we could not understand these things, but later I was",The War of the Worlds_15
36,to learn the meaning of these ominous kopjes that gathered in the,The War of the Worlds_15
36,"twilight. Each of the Martians, standing in the great crescent I have",The War of the Worlds_15
36,"described, had discharged, by means of the gunlike tube he carried, a",The War of the Worlds_15
36,"huge canister over whatever hill, copse, cluster of houses, or other",The War of the Worlds_15
36,"possible cover for guns, chanced to be in front of him. Some fired only",The War of the Worlds_15
36,"one of these, some two—as in the case of the one we had seen; the one",The War of the Worlds_15
36,at Ripley is said to have discharged no fewer than five at that time.,The War of the Worlds_15
36,These canisters smashed on striking the ground—they did not explode—and,The War of the Worlds_15
36,"incontinently disengaged an enormous volume of heavy, inky vapour,",The War of the Worlds_15
36,"coiling and pouring upward in a huge and ebony cumulus cloud, a gaseous",The War of the Worlds_15
36,hill that sank and spread itself slowly over the surrounding country.,The War of the Worlds_15
36,"And the touch of that vapour, the inhaling of its pungent wisps, was",The War of the Worlds_15
36,death to all that breathes.,The War of the Worlds_15
36,,The War of the Worlds_15
36,"It was heavy, this vapour, heavier than the densest smoke, so that,",The War of the Worlds_15
36,"after the first tumultuous uprush and outflow of its impact, it sank",The War of the Worlds_15
36,down through the air and poured over the ground in a manner rather,The War of the Worlds_15
36,"liquid than gaseous, abandoning the hills, and streaming into the",The War of the Worlds_15
36,valleys and ditches and watercourses even as I have heard the,The War of the Worlds_15
36,carbonic-acid gas that pours from volcanic clefts is wont to do. And,The War of the Worlds_15
36,"where it came upon water some chemical action occurred, and the surface",The War of the Worlds_15
36,would be instantly covered with a powdery scum that sank slowly and,The War of the Worlds_15
36,"made way for more. The scum was absolutely insoluble, and it is a",The War of the Worlds_15
36,"strange thing, seeing the instant effect of the gas, that one could",The War of the Worlds_15
36,drink without hurt the water from which it had been strained. The,The War of the Worlds_15
36,vapour did not diffuse as a true gas would do. It hung together in,The War of the Worlds_15
36,"banks, flowing sluggishly down the slope of the land and driving",The War of the Worlds_15
36,"reluctantly before the wind, and very slowly it combined with the mist",The War of the Worlds_15
36,"and moisture of the air, and sank to the earth in the form of dust.",The War of the Worlds_15
36,Save that an unknown element giving a group of four lines in the blue,The War of the Worlds_15
36,"of the spectrum is concerned, we are still entirely ignorant of the",The War of the Worlds_15
36,nature of this substance.,The War of the Worlds_15
36,,The War of the Worlds_15
36,"Once the tumultuous upheaval of its dispersion was over, the black",The War of the Worlds_15
36,"smoke clung so closely to the ground, even before its precipitation,",The War of the Worlds_15
36,"that fifty feet up in the air, on the roofs and upper stories of high",The War of the Worlds_15
36,"houses and on great trees, there was a chance of escaping its poison",The War of the Worlds_15
36,"altogether, as was proved even that night at Street Cobham and Ditton.",The War of the Worlds_15
36,,The War of the Worlds_15
36,The man who escaped at the former place tells a wonderful story of the,The War of the Worlds_15
36,"strangeness of its coiling flow, and how he looked down from the church",The War of the Worlds_15
36,spire and saw the houses of the village rising like ghosts out of its,The War of the Worlds_15
36,"inky nothingness. For a day and a half he remained there, weary,",The War of the Worlds_15
36,"starving and sun-scorched, the earth under the blue sky and against the",The War of the Worlds_15
36,"prospect of the distant hills a velvet-black expanse, with red roofs,",The War of the Worlds_15
36,"green trees, and, later, black-veiled shrubs and gates, barns,",The War of the Worlds_15
36,"outhouses, and walls, rising here and there into the sunlight.",The War of the Worlds_15
36,,The War of the Worlds_15
36,"But that was at Street Cobham, where the black vapour was allowed to",The War of the Worlds_15
36,remain until it sank of its own accord into the ground. As a rule the,The War of the Worlds_15
36,"Martians, when it had served its purpose, cleared the air of it again",The War of the Worlds_15
36,by wading into it and directing a jet of steam upon it.,The War of the Worlds_15
36,,The War of the Worlds_15
36,"This they did with the vapour banks near us, as we saw in the starlight",The War of the Worlds_15
36,"from the window of a deserted house at Upper Halliford, whither we had",The War of the Worlds_15
36,returned. From there we could see the searchlights on Richmond Hill and,The War of the Worlds_15
36,"Kingston Hill going to and fro, and about eleven the windows rattled,",The War of the Worlds_15
36,and we heard the sound of the huge siege guns that had been put in,The War of the Worlds_15
36,position there. These continued intermittently for the space of a,The War of the Worlds_15
36,"quarter of an hour, sending chance shots at the invisible Martians at",The War of the Worlds_15
36,"Hampton and Ditton, and then the pale beams of the electric light",The War of the Worlds_15
36,"vanished, and were replaced by a bright red glow.",The War of the Worlds_15
36,,The War of the Worlds_15
36,Then the fourth cylinder fell—a brilliant green meteor—as I learned,The War of the Worlds_15
36,"afterwards, in Bushey Park. Before the guns on the Richmond and",The War of the Worlds_15
36,"Kingston line of hills began, there was a fitful cannonade far away in",The War of the Worlds_15
36,"the southwest, due, I believe, to guns being fired haphazard before the",The War of the Worlds_15
36,black vapour could overwhelm the gunners.,The War of the Worlds_15
36,,The War of the Worlds_15
36,"So, setting about it as methodically as men might smoke out a wasps’",The War of the Worlds_15
36,"nest, the Martians spread this strange stifling vapour over the",The War of the Worlds_15
36,"Londonward country. The horns of the crescent slowly moved apart, until",The War of the Worlds_15
36,at last they formed a line from Hanwell to Coombe and Malden. All night,The War of the Worlds_15
36,"through their destructive tubes advanced. Never once, after the Martian",The War of the Worlds_15
36,"at St. George’s Hill was brought down, did they give the artillery the",The War of the Worlds_15
36,ghost of a chance against them. Wherever there was a possibility of,The War of the Worlds_15
36,"guns being laid for them unseen, a fresh canister of the black vapour",The War of the Worlds_15
36,"was discharged, and where the guns were openly displayed the Heat-Ray",The War of the Worlds_15
36,was brought to bear.,The War of the Worlds_15
36,,The War of the Worlds_15
36,By midnight the blazing trees along the slopes of Richmond Park and the,The War of the Worlds_15
36,"glare of Kingston Hill threw their light upon a network of black smoke,",The War of the Worlds_15
36,blotting out the whole valley of the Thames and extending as far as the,The War of the Worlds_15
36,"eye could reach. And through this two Martians slowly waded, and turned",The War of the Worlds_15
36,their hissing steam jets this way and that.,The War of the Worlds_15
36,,The War of the Worlds_15
36,"They were sparing of the Heat-Ray that night, either because they had",The War of the Worlds_15
36,but a limited supply of material for its production or because they did,The War of the Worlds_15
36,not wish to destroy the country but only to crush and overawe the,The War of the Worlds_15
36,opposition they had aroused. In the latter aim they certainly,The War of the Worlds_15
36,succeeded. Sunday night was the end of the organised opposition to,The War of the Worlds_15
36,"their movements. After that no body of men would stand against them, so",The War of the Worlds_15
36,hopeless was the enterprise. Even the crews of the torpedo-boats and,The War of the Worlds_15
36,destroyers that had brought their quick-firers up the Thames refused to,The War of the Worlds_15
36,"stop, mutinied, and went down again. The only offensive operation men",The War of the Worlds_15
36,ventured upon after that night was the preparation of mines and,The War of the Worlds_15
36,"pitfalls, and even in that their energies were frantic and spasmodic.",The War of the Worlds_15
36,,The War of the Worlds_15
36,"One has to imagine, as well as one may, the fate of those batteries",The War of the Worlds_15
36,"towards Esher, waiting so tensely in the twilight. Survivors there were",The War of the Worlds_15
36,"none. One may picture the orderly expectation, the officers alert and",The War of the Worlds_15
36,"watchful, the gunners ready, the ammunition piled to hand, the limber",The War of the Worlds_15
36,"gunners with their horses and waggons, the groups of civilian",The War of the Worlds_15
36,"spectators standing as near as they were permitted, the evening",The War of the Worlds_15
36,"stillness, the ambulances and hospital tents with the burned and",The War of the Worlds_15
36,wounded from Weybridge; then the dull resonance of the shots the,The War of the Worlds_15
36,"Martians fired, and the clumsy projectile whirling over the trees and",The War of the Worlds_15
36,houses and smashing amid the neighbouring fields.,The War of the Worlds_15
36,,The War of the Worlds_15
36,"One may picture, too, the sudden shifting of the attention, the swiftly",The War of the Worlds_15
36,"spreading coils and bellyings of that blackness advancing headlong,",The War of the Worlds_15
36,"towering heavenward, turning the twilight to a palpable darkness, a",The War of the Worlds_15
36,"strange and horrible antagonist of vapour striding upon its victims,",The War of the Worlds_15
36,"men and horses near it seen dimly, running, shrieking, falling",The War of the Worlds_15
36,"headlong, shouts of dismay, the guns suddenly abandoned, men choking",The War of the Worlds_15
36,"and writhing on the ground, and the swift broadening-out of the opaque",The War of the Worlds_15
36,cone of smoke. And then night and extinction—nothing but a silent mass,The War of the Worlds_15
36,of impenetrable vapour hiding its dead.,The War of the Worlds_15
36,,The War of the Worlds_15
36,Before dawn the black vapour was pouring through the streets of,The War of the Worlds_15
36,"Richmond, and the disintegrating organism of government was, with a",The War of the Worlds_15
36,"last expiring effort, rousing the population of London to the necessity",The War of the Worlds_15

36,,The War of the Worlds_16
36,,The War of the Worlds_16
36,So you understand the roaring wave of fear that swept through the,The War of the Worlds_16
36,greatest city in the world just as Monday was dawning—the stream of,The War of the Worlds_16
36,"flight rising swiftly to a torrent, lashing in a foaming tumult round",The War of the Worlds_16
36,"the railway stations, banked up into a horrible struggle about the",The War of the Worlds_16
36,"shipping in the Thames, and hurrying by every available channel",The War of the Worlds_16
36,"northward and eastward. By ten o’clock the police organisation, and by",The War of the Worlds_16
36,"midday even the railway organisations, were losing coherency, losing",The War of the Worlds_16
36,"shape and efficiency, guttering, softening, running at last in that",The War of the Worlds_16
36,swift liquefaction of the social body.,The War of the Worlds_16
36,,The War of the Worlds_16
36,All the railway lines north of the Thames and the South-Eastern people,The War of the Worlds_16
36,"at Cannon Street had been warned by midnight on Sunday, and trains were",The War of the Worlds_16
36,being filled. People were fighting savagely for standing-room in the,The War of the Worlds_16
36,"carriages even at two o’clock. By three, people were being trampled and",The War of the Worlds_16
36,"crushed even in Bishopsgate Street, a couple of hundred yards or more",The War of the Worlds_16
36,"from Liverpool Street station; revolvers were fired, people stabbed,",The War of the Worlds_16
36,"and the policemen who had been sent to direct the traffic, exhausted",The War of the Worlds_16
36,"and infuriated, were breaking the heads of the people they were called",The War of the Worlds_16
36,out to protect.,The War of the Worlds_16
36,,The War of the Worlds_16
36,And as the day advanced and the engine drivers and stokers refused to,The War of the Worlds_16
36,"return to London, the pressure of the flight drove the people in an",The War of the Worlds_16
36,ever-thickening multitude away from the stations and along the,The War of the Worlds_16
36,"northward-running roads. By midday a Martian had been seen at Barnes,",The War of the Worlds_16
36,and a cloud of slowly sinking black vapour drove along the Thames and,The War of the Worlds_16
36,"across the flats of Lambeth, cutting off all escape over the bridges in",The War of the Worlds_16
36,"its sluggish advance. Another bank drove over Ealing, and surrounded a",The War of the Worlds_16
36,"little island of survivors on Castle Hill, alive, but unable to escape.",The War of the Worlds_16
36,,The War of the Worlds_16
36,After a fruitless struggle to get aboard a North-Western train at Chalk,The War of the Worlds_16
36,Farm—the engines of the trains that had loaded in the goods yard there,The War of the Worlds_16
36,"_ploughed_ through shrieking people, and a dozen stalwart men fought to",The War of the Worlds_16
36,keep the crowd from crushing the driver against his furnace—my brother,The War of the Worlds_16
36,"emerged upon the Chalk Farm road, dodged across through a hurrying",The War of the Worlds_16
36,"swarm of vehicles, and had the luck to be foremost in the sack of a",The War of the Worlds_16
36,cycle shop. The front tire of the machine he got was punctured in,The War of the Worlds_16
36,"dragging it through the window, but he got up and off, notwithstanding,",The War of the Worlds_16
36,with no further injury than a cut wrist. The steep foot of Haverstock,The War of the Worlds_16
36,"Hill was impassable owing to several overturned horses, and my brother",The War of the Worlds_16
36,struck into Belsize Road.,The War of the Worlds_16
36,,The War of the Worlds_16
36,"So he got out of the fury of the panic, and, skirting the Edgware Road,",The War of the Worlds_16
36,"reached Edgware about seven, fasting and wearied, but well ahead of the",The War of the Worlds_16
36,"crowd. Along the road people were standing in the roadway, curious,",The War of the Worlds_16
36,"wondering. He was passed by a number of cyclists, some horsemen, and",The War of the Worlds_16
36,"two motor cars. A mile from Edgware the rim of the wheel broke, and the",The War of the Worlds_16
36,machine became unridable. He left it by the roadside and trudged,The War of the Worlds_16
36,through the village. There were shops half opened in the main street of,The War of the Worlds_16
36,"the place, and people crowded on the pavement and in the doorways and",The War of the Worlds_16
36,"windows, staring astonished at this extraordinary procession of",The War of the Worlds_16
36,fugitives that was beginning. He succeeded in getting some food at an,The War of the Worlds_16
36,inn.,The War of the Worlds_16
36,,The War of the Worlds_16
36,For a time he remained in Edgware not knowing what next to do. The,The War of the Worlds_16
36,"flying people increased in number. Many of them, like my brother,",The War of the Worlds_16
36,seemed inclined to loiter in the place. There was no fresh news of the,The War of the Worlds_16
36,invaders from Mars.,The War of the Worlds_16
36,,The War of the Worlds_16
36,"At that time the road was crowded, but as yet far from congested. Most",The War of the Worlds_16
36,"of the fugitives at that hour were mounted on cycles, but there were",The War of the Worlds_16
36,"soon motor cars, hansom cabs, and carriages hurrying along, and the",The War of the Worlds_16
36,dust hung in heavy clouds along the road to St. Albans.,The War of the Worlds_16
36,,The War of the Worlds_16
36,"It was perhaps a vague idea of making his way to Chelmsford, where some",The War of the Worlds_16

36,"quiet lane running eastward. Presently he came upon a stile, and,",The War of the Worlds_16
36,"crossing it, followed a footpath northeastward. He passed near several",The War of the Worlds_16
36,farmhouses and some little places whose names he did not learn. He saw,The War of the Worlds_16
36,"few fugitives until, in a grass lane towards High Barnet, he happened",The War of the Worlds_16
36,upon two ladies who became his fellow travellers. He came upon them,The War of the Worlds_16
36,just in time to save them.,The War of the Worlds_16
36,,The War of the Worlds_16
36,"He heard their screams, and, hurrying round the corner, saw a couple of",The War of the Worlds_16
36,men struggling to drag them out of the little pony-chaise in which they,The War of the Worlds_16
36,"had been driving, while a third with difficulty held the frightened",The War of the Worlds_16
36,"pony’s head. One of the ladies, a short woman dressed in white, was",The War of the Worlds_16
36,"simply screaming; the other, a dark, slender figure, slashed at the man",The War of the Worlds_16
36,who gripped her arm with a whip she held in her disengaged hand.,The War of the Worlds_16
36,,The War of the Worlds_16
36,"My brother immediately grasped the situation, shouted, and hurried",The War of the Worlds_16
36,"towards the struggle. One of the men desisted and turned towards him,",The War of the Worlds_16
36,"and my brother, realising from his antagonist’s face that a fight was",The War of the Worlds_16
36,"unavoidable, and being an expert boxer, went into him forthwith and",The War of the Worlds_16
36,sent him down against the wheel of the chaise.,The War of the Worlds_16
36,,The War of the Worlds_16
36,It was no time for pugilistic chivalry and my brother laid him quiet,The War of the Worlds_16
36,"with a kick, and gripped the collar of the man who pulled at the",The War of the Worlds_16
36,"slender lady’s arm. He heard the clatter of hoofs, the whip stung",The War of the Worlds_16
36,"across his face, a third antagonist struck him between the eyes, and",The War of the Worlds_16
36,the man he held wrenched himself free and made off down the lane in the,The War of the Worlds_16
36,direction from which he had come.,The War of the Worlds_16
36,,The War of the Worlds_16
36,"Partly stunned, he found himself facing the man who had held the",The War of the Worlds_16
36,"horse’s head, and became aware of the chaise receding from him down the",The War of the Worlds_16
36,"lane, swaying from side to side, and with the women in it looking back.",The War of the Worlds_16
36,"The man before him, a burly rough, tried to close, and he stopped him",The War of the Worlds_16
36,"with a blow in the face. Then, realising that he was deserted, he",The War of the Worlds_16
36,"dodged round and made off down the lane after the chaise, with the",The War of the Worlds_16
36,"sturdy man close behind him, and the fugitive, who had turned now,",The War of the Worlds_16
36,following remotely.,The War of the Worlds_16
36,,The War of the Worlds_16
36,"Suddenly he stumbled and fell; his immediate pursuer went headlong, and",The War of the Worlds_16
36,he rose to his feet to find himself with a couple of antagonists again.,The War of the Worlds_16
36,He would have had little chance against them had not the slender lady,The War of the Worlds_16
36,very pluckily pulled up and returned to his help. It seems she had had,The War of the Worlds_16
36,"a revolver all this time, but it had been under the seat when she and",The War of the Worlds_16
36,"her companion were attacked. She fired at six yards’ distance, narrowly",The War of the Worlds_16
36,"missing my brother. The less courageous of the robbers made off, and",The War of the Worlds_16
36,"his companion followed him, cursing his cowardice. They both stopped in",The War of the Worlds_16
36,"sight down the lane, where the third man lay insensible.",The War of the Worlds_16
36,,The War of the Worlds_16
36,"“Take this!” said the slender lady, and she gave my brother her",The War of the Worlds_16
36,revolver.,The War of the Worlds_16
36,,The War of the Worlds_16
36,"“Go back to the chaise,” said my brother, wiping the blood from his",The War of the Worlds_16
36,split lip.,The War of the Worlds_16
36,,The War of the Worlds_16
36,She turned without a word—they were both panting—and they went back to,The War of the Worlds_16
36,where the lady in white struggled to hold back the frightened pony.,The War of the Worlds_16
36,,The War of the Worlds_16
36,The robbers had evidently had enough of it. When my brother looked,The War of the Worlds_16
36,again they were retreating.,The War of the Worlds_16
36,,The War of the Worlds_16
36,"“I’ll sit here,” said my brother, “if I may”; and he got upon the empty",The War of the Worlds_16
36,front seat. The lady looked over her shoulder.,The War of the Worlds_16
36,,The War of the Worlds_16
36,"“Give me the reins,” she said, and laid the whip along the pony’s side.",The War of the Worlds_16
36,In another moment a bend in the road hid the three men from my,The War of the Worlds_16
36,brother’s eyes.,The War of the Worlds_16
36,,The War of the Worlds_16
36,"So, quite unexpectedly, my brother found himself, panting, with a cut",The War of the Worlds_16
36,"mouth, a bruised jaw, and bloodstained knuckles, driving along an",The War of the Worlds_16
36,unknown lane with these two women.,The War of the Worlds_16
36,,The War of the Worlds_16
36,He learned they were the wife and the younger sister of a surgeon,The War of the Worlds_16
36,"living at Stanmore, who had come in the small hours from a dangerous",The War of the Worlds_16
36,"case at Pinner, and heard at some railway station on his way of the",The War of the Worlds_16
36,"Martian advance. He had hurried home, roused the women—their servant",The War of the Worlds_16
36,"had left them two days before—packed some provisions, put his revolver",The War of the Worlds_16
36,under the seat—luckily for my brother—and told them to drive on to,The War of the Worlds_16
36,"Edgware, with the idea of getting a train there. He stopped behind to",The War of the Worlds_16
36,"tell the neighbours. He would overtake them, he said, at about half",The War of the Worlds_16
36,"past four in the morning, and now it was nearly nine and they had seen",The War of the Worlds_16
36,nothing of him. They could not stop in Edgware because of the growing,The War of the Worlds_16
36,"traffic through the place, and so they had come into this side lane.",The War of the Worlds_16
36,,The War of the Worlds_16
36,That was the story they told my brother in fragments when presently,The War of the Worlds_16
36,"they stopped again, nearer to New Barnet. He promised to stay with",The War of the Worlds_16
36,"them, at least until they could determine what to do, or until the",The War of the Worlds_16
36,"missing man arrived, and professed to be an expert shot with the",The War of the Worlds_16
36,revolver—a weapon strange to him—in order to give them confidence.,The War of the Worlds_16
36,,The War of the Worlds_16
36,"They made a sort of encampment by the wayside, and the pony became",The War of the Worlds_16
36,"happy in the hedge. He told them of his own escape out of London, and",The War of the Worlds_16
36,all that he knew of these Martians and their ways. The sun crept higher,The War of the Worlds_16
36,"in the sky, and after a time their talk died out and gave place to an",The War of the Worlds_16
36,"uneasy state of anticipation. Several wayfarers came along the lane,",The War of the Worlds_16
36,and of these my brother gathered such news as he could. Every broken,The War of the Worlds_16
36,answer he had deepened his impression of the great disaster that had,The War of the Worlds_16
36,"come on humanity, deepened his persuasion of the immediate necessity",The War of the Worlds_16
36,for prosecuting this flight. He urged the matter upon them.,The War of the Worlds_16
36,,The War of the Worlds_16
36,"“We have money,” said the slender woman, and hesitated.",The War of the Worlds_16
36,,The War of the Worlds_16
36,"Her eyes met my brother’s, and her hesitation ended.",The War of the Worlds_16
36,,The War of the Worlds_16
36,"“So have I,” said my brother.",The War of the Worlds_16
36,,The War of the Worlds_16
36,"She explained that they had as much as thirty pounds in gold, besides a",The War of the Worlds_16
36,"five-pound note, and suggested that with that they might get upon a",The War of the Worlds_16
36,train at St. Albans or New Barnet. My brother thought that was,The War of the Worlds_16
36,"hopeless, seeing the fury of the Londoners to crowd upon the trains,",The War of the Worlds_16
36,and broached his own idea of striking across Essex towards Harwich and,The War of the Worlds_16
36,thence escaping from the country altogether.,The War of the Worlds_16
36,,The War of the Worlds_16
36,Mrs. Elphinstone—that was the name of the woman in white—would listen,The War of the Worlds_16
36,"to no reasoning, and kept calling upon “George”; but her sister-in-law",The War of the Worlds_16
36,"was astonishingly quiet and deliberate, and at last agreed to my",The War of the Worlds_16
36,"brother’s suggestion. So, designing to cross the Great North Road, they",The War of the Worlds_16
36,"went on towards Barnet, my brother leading the pony to save it as much",The War of the Worlds_16
36,as possible. As the sun crept up the sky the day became excessively,The War of the Worlds_16
36,"hot, and under foot a thick, whitish sand grew burning and blinding, so",The War of the Worlds_16
36,that they travelled only very slowly. The hedges were grey with dust.,The War of the Worlds_16
36,And as they advanced towards Barnet a tumultuous murmuring grew,The War of the Worlds_16
36,stronger.,The War of the Worlds_16
36,,The War of the Worlds_16
36,They began to meet more people. For the most part these were staring,The War of the Worlds_16
36,"before them, murmuring indistinct questions, jaded, haggard, unclean.",The War of the Worlds_16
36,"One man in evening dress passed them on foot, his eyes on the ground.",The War of the Worlds_16
36,"They heard his voice, and, looking back at him, saw one hand clutched",The War of the Worlds_16
36,in his hair and the other beating invisible things. His paroxysm of,The War of the Worlds_16
36,"rage over, he went on his way without once looking back.",The War of the Worlds_16
36,,The War of the Worlds_16
36,As my brother’s party went on towards the crossroads to the south of,The War of the Worlds_16
36,Barnet they saw a woman approaching the road across some fields on,The War of the Worlds_16
36,"their left, carrying a child and with two other children; and then",The War of the Worlds_16
36,"passed a man in dirty black, with a thick stick in one hand and a small",The War of the Worlds_16
36,"portmanteau in the other. Then round the corner of the lane, from",The War of the Worlds_16
36,between the villas that guarded it at its confluence with the high,The War of the Worlds_16
36,"road, came a little cart drawn by a sweating black pony and driven by a",The War of the Worlds_16
36,"sallow youth in a bowler hat, grey with dust. There were three girls,",The War of the Worlds_16
36,"East End factory girls, and a couple of little children crowded in the",The War of the Worlds_16
36,cart.,The War of the Worlds_16
36,,The War of the Worlds_16
36,"“This’ll tike us rahnd Edgware?” asked the driver, wild-eyed,",The War of the Worlds_16
36,white-faced; and when my brother told him it would if he turned to the,The War of the Worlds_16
36,"left, he whipped up at once without the formality of thanks.",The War of the Worlds_16
36,,The War of the Worlds_16
36,My brother noticed a pale grey smoke or haze rising among the houses in,The War of the Worlds_16
36,"front of them, and veiling the white façade of a terrace beyond the",The War of the Worlds_16
36,road that appeared between the backs of the villas. Mrs. Elphinstone,The War of the Worlds_16
36,suddenly cried out at a number of tongues of smoky red flame leaping up,The War of the Worlds_16
36,"above the houses in front of them against the hot, blue sky. The",The War of the Worlds_16
36,tumultuous noise resolved itself now into the disorderly mingling of,The War of the Worlds_16
36,"many voices, the gride of many wheels, the creaking of waggons, and the",The War of the Worlds_16
36,staccato of hoofs. The lane came round sharply not fifty yards from the,The War of the Worlds_16
36,crossroads.,The War of the Worlds_16
36,,The War of the Worlds_16
36,“Good heavens!” cried Mrs. Elphinstone. “What is this you are driving,The War of the Worlds_16
36,us into?”,The War of the Worlds_16
36,,The War of the Worlds_16
36,My brother stopped.,The War of the Worlds_16
36,,The War of the Worlds_16
36,"For the main road was a boiling stream of people, a torrent of human",The War of the Worlds_16
36,"beings rushing northward, one pressing on another. A great bank of",The War of the Worlds_16
36,"dust, white and luminous in the blaze of the sun, made everything",The War of the Worlds_16
36,within twenty feet of the ground grey and indistinct and was,The War of the Worlds_16
36,perpetually renewed by the hurrying feet of a dense crowd of horses and,The War of the Worlds_16
36,"of men and women on foot, and by the wheels of vehicles of every",The War of the Worlds_16
36,description.,The War of the Worlds_16
36,,The War of the Worlds_16
36,“Way!” my brother heard voices crying. “Make way!”,The War of the Worlds_16
36,,The War of the Worlds_16
36,It was like riding into the smoke of a fire to approach the meeting,The War of the Worlds_16
36,"point of the lane and road; the crowd roared like a fire, and the dust",The War of the Worlds_16
36,"was hot and pungent. And, indeed, a little way up the road a villa was",The War of the Worlds_16
36,burning and sending rolling masses of black smoke across the road to,The War of the Worlds_16
36,add to the confusion.,The War of the Worlds_16
36,,The War of the Worlds_16
36,"Two men came past them. Then a dirty woman, carrying a heavy bundle and",The War of the Worlds_16
36,"weeping. A lost retriever dog, with hanging tongue, circled dubiously",The War of the Worlds_16
36,"round them, scared and wretched, and fled at my brother’s threat.",The War of the Worlds_16
36,,The War of the Worlds_16
36,So much as they could see of the road Londonward between the houses to,The War of the Worlds_16
36,"the right was a tumultuous stream of dirty, hurrying people, pent in",The War of the Worlds_16
36,"between the villas on either side; the black heads, the crowded forms,",The War of the Worlds_16
36,"grew into distinctness as they rushed towards the corner, hurried past,",The War of the Worlds_16
36,and merged their individuality again in a receding multitude that was,The War of the Worlds_16
36,swallowed up at last in a cloud of dust.,The War of the Worlds_16
36,,The War of the Worlds_16
36,“Go on! Go on!” cried the voices. “Way! Way!”,The War of the Worlds_16
36,,The War of the Worlds_16
36,One man’s hands pressed on the back of another. My brother stood at the,The War of the Worlds_16
36,"pony’s head. Irresistibly attracted, he advanced slowly, pace by pace,",The War of the Worlds_16
36,down the lane.,The War of the Worlds_16
36,,The War of the Worlds_16
36,"Edgware had been a scene of confusion, Chalk Farm a riotous tumult, but",The War of the Worlds_16
36,this was a whole population in movement. It is hard to imagine that,The War of the Worlds_16
36,host. It had no character of its own. The figures poured out past the,The War of the Worlds_16
36,"corner, and receded with their backs to the group in the lane. Along",The War of the Worlds_16
36,"the margin came those who were on foot threatened by the wheels,",The War of the Worlds_16
36,"stumbling in the ditches, blundering into one another.",The War of the Worlds_16
36,,The War of the Worlds_16
36,"The carts and carriages crowded close upon one another, making little",The War of the Worlds_16
36,way for those swifter and more impatient vehicles that darted forward,The War of the Worlds_16
36,"every now and then when an opportunity showed itself of doing so,",The War of the Worlds_16
36,sending the people scattering against the fences and gates of the,The War of the Worlds_16
36,villas.,The War of the Worlds_16
36,,The War of the Worlds_16
36,“Push on!” was the cry. “Push on! They are coming!”,The War of the Worlds_16
36,,The War of the Worlds_16
36,"In one cart stood a blind man in the uniform of the Salvation Army,",The War of the Worlds_16
36,"gesticulating with his crooked fingers and bawling, “Eternity!",The War of the Worlds_16
36,Eternity!” His voice was hoarse and very loud so that my brother could,The War of the Worlds_16
36,hear him long after he was lost to sight in the dust. Some of the,The War of the Worlds_16
36,people who crowded in the carts whipped stupidly at their horses and,The War of the Worlds_16
36,"quarrelled with other drivers; some sat motionless, staring at nothing",The War of the Worlds_16
36,"with miserable eyes; some gnawed their hands with thirst, or lay",The War of the Worlds_16
36,prostrate in the bottoms of their conveyances. The horses’ bits were,The War of the Worlds_16
36,"covered with foam, their eyes bloodshot.",The War of the Worlds_16
36,,The War of the Worlds_16
36,"There were cabs, carriages, shop-carts, waggons, beyond counting; a",The War of the Worlds_16
36,"mail cart, a road-cleaner’s cart marked “Vestry of St. Pancras,” a huge",The War of the Worlds_16
36,timber waggon crowded with roughs. A brewer’s dray rumbled by with its,The War of the Worlds_16
36,two near wheels splashed with fresh blood.,The War of the Worlds_16
36,,The War of the Worlds_16
36,“Clear the way!” cried the voices. “Clear the way!”,The War of the Worlds_16
36,,The War of the Worlds_16
36,“Eter-nity! Eter-nity!” came echoing down the road.,The War of the Worlds_16
36,,The War of the Worlds_16
36,"There were sad, haggard women tramping by, well dressed, with children",The War of the Worlds_16
36,"that cried and stumbled, their dainty clothes smothered in dust, their",The War of the Worlds_16
36,"weary faces smeared with tears. With many of these came men, sometimes",The War of the Worlds_16
36,"helpful, sometimes lowering and savage. Fighting side by side with them",The War of the Worlds_16
36,"pushed some weary street outcast in faded black rags, wide-eyed,",The War of the Worlds_16
36,"loud-voiced, and foul-mouthed. There were sturdy workmen thrusting",The War of the Worlds_16
36,"their way along, wretched, unkempt men, clothed like clerks or shopmen,",The War of the Worlds_16
36,"struggling spasmodically; a wounded soldier my brother noticed, men",The War of the Worlds_16
36,"dressed in the clothes of railway porters, one wretched creature in a",The War of the Worlds_16
36,nightshirt with a coat thrown over it.,The War of the Worlds_16
36,,The War of the Worlds_16
36,"But varied as its composition was, certain things all that host had in",The War of the Worlds_16
36,"common. There were fear and pain on their faces, and fear behind them.",The War of the Worlds_16
36,"A tumult up the road, a quarrel for a place in a waggon, sent the whole",The War of the Worlds_16
36,host of them quickening their pace; even a man so scared and broken,The War of the Worlds_16
36,that his knees bent under him was galvanised for a moment into renewed,The War of the Worlds_16
36,activity. The heat and dust had already been at work upon this,The War of the Worlds_16
36,"multitude. Their skins were dry, their lips black and cracked. They",The War of the Worlds_16
36,"were all thirsty, weary, and footsore. And amid the various cries one",The War of the Worlds_16
36,"heard disputes, reproaches, groans of weariness and fatigue; the voices",The War of the Worlds_16
36,of most of them were hoarse and weak. Through it all ran a refrain:,The War of the Worlds_16
36,,The War of the Worlds_16
36,“Way! Way! The Martians are coming!”,The War of the Worlds_16
36,,The War of the Worlds_16
36,Few stopped and came aside from that flood. The lane opened slantingly,The War of the Worlds_16
36,"into the main road with a narrow opening, and had a delusive appearance",The War of the Worlds_16
36,of coming from the direction of London. Yet a kind of eddy of people,The War of the Worlds_16
36,"drove into its mouth; weaklings elbowed out of the stream, who for the",The War of the Worlds_16
36,most part rested but a moment before plunging into it again. A little,The War of the Worlds_16
36,"way down the lane, with two friends bending over him, lay a man with a",The War of the Worlds_16
36,"bare leg, wrapped about with bloody rags. He was a lucky man to have",The War of the Worlds_16
36,friends.,The War of the Worlds_16
36,,The War of the Worlds_16
36,"A little old man, with a grey military moustache and a filthy black",The War of the Worlds_16
36,"frock coat, limped out and sat down beside the trap, removed his",The War of the Worlds_16
36,"boot—his sock was blood-stained—shook out a pebble, and hobbled on",The War of the Worlds_16
36,"again; and then a little girl of eight or nine, all alone, threw",The War of the Worlds_16
36,"herself under the hedge close by my brother, weeping.",The War of the Worlds_16
36,,The War of the Worlds_16
36,“I can’t go on! I can’t go on!”,The War of the Worlds_16
36,,The War of the Worlds_16
36,"My brother woke from his torpor of astonishment and lifted her up,",The War of the Worlds_16
36,"speaking gently to her, and carried her to Miss Elphinstone. So soon as",The War of the Worlds_16
36,"my brother touched her she became quite still, as if frightened.",The War of the Worlds_16
36,,The War of the Worlds_16
36,"“Ellen!” shrieked a woman in the crowd, with tears in her",The War of the Worlds_16
36,"voice—“Ellen!” And the child suddenly darted away from my brother,",The War of the Worlds_16
36,crying “Mother!”,The War of the Worlds_16
36,,The War of the Worlds_16
36,"“They are coming,” said a man on horseback, riding past along the lane.",The War of the Worlds_16
36,,The War of the Worlds_16
36,"“Out of the way, there!” bawled a coachman, towering high; and my",The War of the Worlds_16
36,brother saw a closed carriage turning into the lane.,The War of the Worlds_16
36,,The War of the Worlds_16
36,The people crushed back on one another to avoid the horse. My brother,The War of the Worlds_16
36,"pushed the pony and chaise back into the hedge, and the man drove by",The War of the Worlds_16
36,"and stopped at the turn of the way. It was a carriage, with a pole for",The War of the Worlds_16
36,"a pair of horses, but only one was in the traces. My brother saw dimly",The War of the Worlds_16
36,through the dust that two men lifted out something on a white stretcher,The War of the Worlds_16
36,and put it gently on the grass beneath the privet hedge.,The War of the Worlds_16
36,,The War of the Worlds_16
36,One of the men came running to my brother.,The War of the Worlds_16
36,,The War of the Worlds_16
36,"“Where is there any water?” he said. “He is dying fast, and very",The War of the Worlds_16
36,thirsty. It is Lord Garrick.”,The War of the Worlds_16
36,,The War of the Worlds_16
36,“Lord Garrick!” said my brother; “the Chief Justice?”,The War of the Worlds_16
36,,The War of the Worlds_16
36,“The water?” he said.,The War of the Worlds_16
36,,The War of the Worlds_16
36,"“There may be a tap,” said my brother, “in some of the houses. We have",The War of the Worlds_16
36,no water. I dare not leave my people.”,The War of the Worlds_16
36,,The War of the Worlds_16
36,The man pushed against the crowd towards the gate of the corner house.,The War of the Worlds_16
36,,The War of the Worlds_16
36,"“Go on!” said the people, thrusting at him. “They are coming! Go on!”",The War of the Worlds_16
36,,The War of the Worlds_16
36,"Then my brother’s attention was distracted by a bearded, eagle-faced",The War of the Worlds_16
36,"man lugging a small handbag, which split even as my brother’s eyes",The War of the Worlds_16
36,rested on it and disgorged a mass of sovereigns that seemed to break up,The War of the Worlds_16
36,into separate coins as it struck the ground. They rolled hither and,The War of the Worlds_16
36,thither among the struggling feet of men and horses. The man stopped,The War of the Worlds_16
36,"and looked stupidly at the heap, and the shaft of a cab struck his",The War of the Worlds_16
36,"shoulder and sent him reeling. He gave a shriek and dodged back, and a",The War of the Worlds_16
36,cartwheel shaved him narrowly.,The War of the Worlds_16
36,,The War of the Worlds_16
36,“Way!” cried the men all about him. “Make way!”,The War of the Worlds_16
36,,The War of the Worlds_16
36,"So soon as the cab had passed, he flung himself, with both hands open,",The War of the Worlds_16
36,"upon the heap of coins, and began thrusting handfuls in his pocket. A",The War of the Worlds_16
36,"horse rose close upon him, and in another moment, half rising, he had",The War of the Worlds_16
36,been borne down under the horse’s hoofs.,The War of the Worlds_16
36,,The War of the Worlds_16
36,"“Stop!” screamed my brother, and pushing a woman out of his way, tried",The War of the Worlds_16
36,to clutch the bit of the horse.,The War of the Worlds_16
36,,The War of the Worlds_16
36,"Before he could get to it, he heard a scream under the wheels, and saw",The War of the Worlds_16
36,through the dust the rim passing over the poor wretch’s back. The,The War of the Worlds_16
36,"driver of the cart slashed his whip at my brother, who ran round behind",The War of the Worlds_16
36,the cart. The multitudinous shouting confused his ears. The man was,The War of the Worlds_16
36,"writhing in the dust among his scattered money, unable to rise, for the",The War of the Worlds_16
36,"wheel had broken his back, and his lower limbs lay limp and dead. My",The War of the Worlds_16
36,"brother stood up and yelled at the next driver, and a man on a black",The War of the Worlds_16
36,horse came to his assistance.,The War of the Worlds_16
36,,The War of the Worlds_16
36,"“Get him out of the road,” said he; and, clutching the man’s collar",The War of the Worlds_16
36,"with his free hand, my brother lugged him sideways. But he still",The War of the Worlds_16
36,"clutched after his money, and regarded my brother fiercely, hammering",The War of the Worlds_16
36,at his arm with a handful of gold. “Go on! Go on!” shouted angry voices,The War of the Worlds_16
36,behind. “Way! Way!”,The War of the Worlds_16
36,,The War of the Worlds_16
36,There was a smash as the pole of a carriage crashed into the cart that,The War of the Worlds_16
36,"the man on horseback stopped. My brother looked up, and the man with",The War of the Worlds_16
36,the gold twisted his head round and bit the wrist that held his collar.,The War of the Worlds_16
36,"There was a concussion, and the black horse came staggering sideways,",The War of the Worlds_16
36,and the carthorse pushed beside it. A hoof missed my brother’s foot by,The War of the Worlds_16
36,a hair’s breadth. He released his grip on the fallen man and jumped,The War of the Worlds_16
36,back. He saw anger change to terror on the face of the poor wretch on,The War of the Worlds_16
36,"the ground, and in a moment he was hidden and my brother was borne",The War of the Worlds_16
36,"backward and carried past the entrance of the lane, and had to fight",The War of the Worlds_16
36,hard in the torrent to recover it.,The War of the Worlds_16
36,,The War of the Worlds_16
36,"He saw Miss Elphinstone covering her eyes, and a little child, with all",The War of the Worlds_16
36,"a child’s want of sympathetic imagination, staring with dilated eyes at",The War of the Worlds_16
36,"a dusty something that lay black and still, ground and crushed under",The War of the Worlds_16
36,"the rolling wheels. “Let us go back!” he shouted, and began turning the",The War of the Worlds_16
36,"pony round. “We cannot cross this—hell,” he said and they went back a",The War of the Worlds_16
36,"hundred yards the way they had come, until the fighting crowd was",The War of the Worlds_16
36,hidden. As they passed the bend in the lane my brother saw the face of,The War of the Worlds_16
36,"the dying man in the ditch under the privet, deadly white and drawn,",The War of the Worlds_16
36,"and shining with perspiration. The two women sat silent, crouching in",The War of the Worlds_16
36,their seat and shivering.,The War of the Worlds_16
36,,The War of the Worlds_16
36,Then beyond the bend my brother stopped again. Miss Elphinstone was,The War of the Worlds_16
36,"white and pale, and her sister-in-law sat weeping, too wretched even to",The War of the Worlds_16
36,call upon “George.” My brother was horrified and perplexed. So soon as,The War of the Worlds_16
36,they had retreated he realised how urgent and unavoidable it was to,The War of the Worlds_16
36,"attempt this crossing. He turned to Miss Elphinstone, suddenly",The War of the Worlds_16
36,resolute.,The War of the Worlds_16
36,,The War of the Worlds_16
36,"“We must go that way,” he said, and led the pony round again.",The War of the Worlds_16
36,,The War of the Worlds_16
36,For the second time that day this girl proved her quality. To force,The War of the Worlds_16
36,"their way into the torrent of people, my brother plunged into the",The War of the Worlds_16
36,"traffic and held back a cab horse, while she drove the pony across its",The War of the Worlds_16
36,head. A waggon locked wheels for a moment and ripped a long splinter,The War of the Worlds_16
36,from the chaise. In another moment they were caught and swept forward,The War of the Worlds_16
36,"by the stream. My brother, with the cabman’s whip marks red across his",The War of the Worlds_16
36,"face and hands, scrambled into the chaise and took the reins from her.",The War of the Worlds_16
36,,The War of the Worlds_16
36,"“Point the revolver at the man behind,” he said, giving it to her, “if",The War of the Worlds_16
36,he presses us too hard. No!—point it at his horse.”,The War of the Worlds_16
36,,The War of the Worlds_16
36,Then he began to look out for a chance of edging to the right across,The War of the Worlds_16
36,"the road. But once in the stream he seemed to lose volition, to become",The War of the Worlds_16
36,a part of that dusty rout. They swept through Chipping Barnet with the,The War of the Worlds_16
36,torrent; they were nearly a mile beyond the centre of the town before,The War of the Worlds_16
36,they had fought across to the opposite side of the way. It was din and,The War of the Worlds_16
36,confusion indescribable; but in and beyond the town the road forks,The War of the Worlds_16
36,"repeatedly, and this to some extent relieved the stress.",The War of the Worlds_16
36,,The War of the Worlds_16
36,"They struck eastward through Hadley, and there on either side of the",The War of the Worlds_16
36,"road, and at another place farther on they came upon a great multitude",The War of the Worlds_16
36,"of people drinking at the stream, some fighting to come at the water.",The War of the Worlds_16
36,"And farther on, from a lull near East Barnet, they saw two trains",The War of the Worlds_16
36,running slowly one after the other without signal or order—trains,The War of the Worlds_16
36,"swarming with people, with men even among the coals behind the",The War of the Worlds_16
36,engines—going northward along the Great Northern Railway. My brother,The War of the Worlds_16
36,"supposes they must have filled outside London, for at that time the",The War of the Worlds_16
36,furious terror of the people had rendered the central termini,The War of the Worlds_16
36,impossible.,The War of the Worlds_16
36,,The War of the Worlds_16
36,"Near this place they halted for the rest of the afternoon, for the",The War of the Worlds_16
36,violence of the day had already utterly exhausted all three of them.,The War of the Worlds_16
36,"They began to suffer the beginnings of hunger; the night was cold, and",The War of the Worlds_16
36,none of them dared to sleep. And in the evening many people came,The War of the Worlds_16
36,"hurrying along the road nearby their stopping place, fleeing from",The War of the Worlds_16
36,"unknown dangers before them, and going in the direction from which my",The War of the Worlds_16
36,brother had come.,The War of the Worlds_16
36,,The War of the Worlds_16
36,,The War of the Worlds_16
36,,The War of the Worlds_16

36,THE “THUNDER CHILD”.,The War of the Worlds_17
36,,The War of the Worlds_17
36,,The War of the Worlds_17
36,"Had the Martians aimed only at destruction, they might on Monday have",The War of the Worlds_17
36,"annihilated the entire population of London, as it spread itself slowly",The War of the Worlds_17
36,"through the home counties. Not only along the road through Barnet, but",The War of the Worlds_17
36,"also through Edgware and Waltham Abbey, and along the roads eastward to",The War of the Worlds_17
36,"Southend and Shoeburyness, and south of the Thames to Deal and",The War of the Worlds_17
36,"Broadstairs, poured the same frantic rout. If one could have hung that",The War of the Worlds_17
36,June morning in a balloon in the blazing blue above London every,The War of the Worlds_17
36,northward and eastward road running out of the tangled maze of streets,The War of the Worlds_17
36,"would have seemed stippled black with the streaming fugitives, each dot",The War of the Worlds_17
36,a human agony of terror and physical distress. I have set forth at,The War of the Worlds_17
36,length in the last chapter my brother’s account of the road through,The War of the Worlds_17
36,"Chipping Barnet, in order that my readers may realise how that swarming",The War of the Worlds_17
36,of black dots appeared to one of those concerned. Never before in the,The War of the Worlds_17
36,history of the world had such a mass of human beings moved and suffered,The War of the Worlds_17
36,"together. The legendary hosts of Goths and Huns, the hugest armies Asia",The War of the Worlds_17
36,"has ever seen, would have been but a drop in that current. And this was",The War of the Worlds_17
36,no disciplined march; it was a stampede—a stampede gigantic and,The War of the Worlds_17
36,"terrible—without order and without a goal, six million people unarmed",The War of the Worlds_17
36,"and unprovisioned, driving headlong. It was the beginning of the rout",The War of the Worlds_17
36,"of civilisation, of the massacre of mankind.",The War of the Worlds_17
36,,The War of the Worlds_17
36,Directly below him the balloonist would have seen the network of,The War of the Worlds_17
36,"streets far and wide, houses, churches, squares, crescents,",The War of the Worlds_17
36,"gardens—already derelict—spread out like a huge map, and in the",The War of the Worlds_17
36,"southward _blotted_. Over Ealing, Richmond, Wimbledon, it would have",The War of the Worlds_17
36,"seemed as if some monstrous pen had flung ink upon the chart. Steadily,",The War of the Worlds_17
36,"incessantly, each black splash grew and spread, shooting out",The War of the Worlds_17
36,"ramifications this way and that, now banking itself against rising",The War of the Worlds_17
36,"ground, now pouring swiftly over a crest into a new-found valley,",The War of the Worlds_17
36,exactly as a gout of ink would spread itself upon blotting paper.,The War of the Worlds_17
36,,The War of the Worlds_17
36,"And beyond, over the blue hills that rise southward of the river, the",The War of the Worlds_17
36,"glittering Martians went to and fro, calmly and methodically spreading",The War of the Worlds_17
36,"their poison cloud over this patch of country and then over that,",The War of the Worlds_17
36,"laying it again with their steam jets when it had served its purpose,",The War of the Worlds_17
36,and taking possession of the conquered country. They do not seem to,The War of the Worlds_17
36,have aimed at extermination so much as at complete demoralisation and,The War of the Worlds_17
36,the destruction of any opposition. They exploded any stores of powder,The War of the Worlds_17
36,"they came upon, cut every telegraph, and wrecked the railways here and",The War of the Worlds_17
36,there. They were hamstringing mankind. They seemed in no hurry to,The War of the Worlds_17
36,"extend the field of their operations, and did not come beyond the",The War of the Worlds_17
36,central part of London all that day. It is possible that a very,The War of the Worlds_17
36,considerable number of people in London stuck to their houses through,The War of the Worlds_17
36,Monday morning. Certain it is that many died at home suffocated by the,The War of the Worlds_17
36,Black Smoke.,The War of the Worlds_17
36,,The War of the Worlds_17
36,Until about midday the Pool of London was an astonishing scene.,The War of the Worlds_17
36,"Steamboats and shipping of all sorts lay there, tempted by the enormous",The War of the Worlds_17
36,"sums of money offered by fugitives, and it is said that many who swam",The War of the Worlds_17
36,out to these vessels were thrust off with boathooks and drowned. About,The War of the Worlds_17
36,one o’clock in the afternoon the thinning remnant of a cloud of the,The War of the Worlds_17
36,black vapour appeared between the arches of Blackfriars Bridge. At that,The War of the Worlds_17
36,"the Pool became a scene of mad confusion, fighting, and collision, and",The War of the Worlds_17
36,for some time a multitude of boats and barges jammed in the northern,The War of the Worlds_17
36,"arch of the Tower Bridge, and the sailors and lightermen had to fight",The War of the Worlds_17
36,savagely against the people who swarmed upon them from the riverfront.,The War of the Worlds_17
36,People were actually clambering down the piers of the bridge from,The War of the Worlds_17
36,above.,The War of the Worlds_17
36,,The War of the Worlds_17
36,"When, an hour later, a Martian appeared beyond the Clock Tower and",The War of the Worlds_17
36,"waded down the river, nothing but wreckage floated above Limehouse.",The War of the Worlds_17
36,,The War of the Worlds_17
36,Of the falling of the fifth cylinder I have presently to tell. The,The War of the Worlds_17
36,"sixth star fell at Wimbledon. My brother, keeping watch beside the",The War of the Worlds_17
36,"women in the chaise in a meadow, saw the green flash of it far beyond",The War of the Worlds_17
36,"the hills. On Tuesday the little party, still set upon getting across",The War of the Worlds_17
36,"the sea, made its way through the swarming country towards Colchester.",The War of the Worlds_17
36,The news that the Martians were now in possession of the whole of,The War of the Worlds_17
36,"London was confirmed. They had been seen at Highgate, and even, it was",The War of the Worlds_17
36,"said, at Neasden. But they did not come into my brother’s view until",The War of the Worlds_17
36,the morrow.,The War of the Worlds_17
36,,The War of the Worlds_17
36,That day the scattered multitudes began to realise the urgent need of,The War of the Worlds_17
36,provisions. As they grew hungry the rights of property ceased to be,The War of the Worlds_17
36,"regarded. Farmers were out to defend their cattle-sheds, granaries, and",The War of the Worlds_17
36,"ripening root crops with arms in their hands. A number of people now,",The War of the Worlds_17
36,"like my brother, had their faces eastward, and there were some",The War of the Worlds_17
36,desperate souls even going back towards London to get food. These were,The War of the Worlds_17
36,"chiefly people from the northern suburbs, whose knowledge of the Black",The War of the Worlds_17
36,Smoke came by hearsay. He heard that about half the members of the,The War of the Worlds_17
36,"government had gathered at Birmingham, and that enormous quantities of",The War of the Worlds_17
36,high explosives were being prepared to be used in automatic mines,The War of the Worlds_17
36,across the Midland counties.,The War of the Worlds_17
36,,The War of the Worlds_17
36,He was also told that the Midland Railway Company had replaced the,The War of the Worlds_17
36,"desertions of the first day’s panic, had resumed traffic, and was",The War of the Worlds_17
36,running northward trains from St. Albans to relieve the congestion of,The War of the Worlds_17
36,the home counties. There was also a placard in Chipping Ongar,The War of the Worlds_17
36,announcing that large stores of flour were available in the northern,The War of the Worlds_17
36,towns and that within twenty-four hours bread would be distributed,The War of the Worlds_17
36,among the starving people in the neighbourhood. But this intelligence,The War of the Worlds_17
36,"did not deter him from the plan of escape he had formed, and the three",The War of the Worlds_17
36,"pressed eastward all day, and heard no more of the bread distribution",The War of the Worlds_17
36,"than this promise. Nor, as a matter of fact, did anyone else hear more",The War of the Worlds_17
36,"of it. That night fell the seventh star, falling upon Primrose Hill. It",The War of the Worlds_17
36,"fell while Miss Elphinstone was watching, for she took that duty",The War of the Worlds_17
36,alternately with my brother. She saw it.,The War of the Worlds_17
36,,The War of the Worlds_17
36,On Wednesday the three fugitives—they had passed the night in a field,The War of the Worlds_17
36,"of unripe wheat—reached Chelmsford, and there a body of the",The War of the Worlds_17
36,"inhabitants, calling itself the Committee of Public Supply, seized the",The War of the Worlds_17
36,"pony as provisions, and would give nothing in exchange for it but the",The War of the Worlds_17
36,promise of a share in it the next day. Here there were rumours of,The War of the Worlds_17
36,"Martians at Epping, and news of the destruction of Waltham Abbey Powder",The War of the Worlds_17
36,Mills in a vain attempt to blow up one of the invaders.,The War of the Worlds_17
36,,The War of the Worlds_17
36,People were watching for Martians here from the church towers. My,The War of the Worlds_17
36,"brother, very luckily for him as it chanced, preferred to push on at",The War of the Worlds_17
36,"once to the coast rather than wait for food, although all three of them",The War of the Worlds_17
36,"were very hungry. By midday they passed through Tillingham, which,",The War of the Worlds_17
36,"strangely enough, seemed to be quite silent and deserted, save for a",The War of the Worlds_17
36,few furtive plunderers hunting for food. Near Tillingham they suddenly,The War of the Worlds_17
36,"came in sight of the sea, and the most amazing crowd of shipping of all",The War of the Worlds_17
36,sorts that it is possible to imagine.,The War of the Worlds_17
36,,The War of the Worlds_17
36,"For after the sailors could no longer come up the Thames, they came on",The War of the Worlds_17
36,"to the Essex coast, to Harwich and Walton and Clacton, and afterwards",The War of the Worlds_17
36,"to Foulness and Shoebury, to bring off the people. They lay in a huge",The War of the Worlds_17
36,sickle-shaped curve that vanished into mist at last towards the Naze.,The War of the Worlds_17
36,"Close inshore was a multitude of fishing smacks—English, Scotch,",The War of the Worlds_17
36,"French, Dutch, and Swedish; steam launches from the Thames, yachts,",The War of the Worlds_17
36,"electric boats; and beyond were ships of larger burden, a multitude of",The War of the Worlds_17
36,"filthy colliers, trim merchantmen, cattle ships, passenger boats,",The War of the Worlds_17
36,"petroleum tanks, ocean tramps, an old white transport even, neat white",The War of the Worlds_17
36,and grey liners from Southampton and Hamburg; and along the blue coast,The War of the Worlds_17
36,across the Blackwater my brother could make out dimly a dense swarm of,The War of the Worlds_17
36,"boats chaffering with the people on the beach, a swarm which also",The War of the Worlds_17
36,extended up the Blackwater almost to Maldon.,The War of the Worlds_17
36,,The War of the Worlds_17
36,"About a couple of miles out lay an ironclad, very low in the water,",The War of the Worlds_17
36,"almost, to my brother’s perception, like a water-logged ship. This was",The War of the Worlds_17
36,"the ram _Thunder Child_. It was the only warship in sight, but far away",The War of the Worlds_17
36,to the right over the smooth surface of the sea—for that day there was,The War of the Worlds_17
36,a dead calm—lay a serpent of black smoke to mark the next ironclads of,The War of the Worlds_17
36,"the Channel Fleet, which hovered in an extended line, steam up and",The War of the Worlds_17
36,"ready for action, across the Thames estuary during the course of the",The War of the Worlds_17
36,"Martian conquest, vigilant and yet powerless to prevent it.",The War of the Worlds_17
36,,The War of the Worlds_17
36,"At the sight of the sea, Mrs. Elphinstone, in spite of the assurances",The War of the Worlds_17
36,"of her sister-in-law, gave way to panic. She had never been out of",The War of the Worlds_17
36,"England before, she would rather die than trust herself friendless in a",The War of the Worlds_17
36,"foreign country, and so forth. She seemed, poor woman, to imagine that",The War of the Worlds_17
36,the French and the Martians might prove very similar. She had been,The War of the Worlds_17
36,"growing increasingly hysterical, fearful, and depressed during the two",The War of the Worlds_17
36,days’ journeyings. Her great idea was to return to Stanmore. Things had,The War of the Worlds_17
36,been always well and safe at Stanmore. They would find George at,The War of the Worlds_17
36,Stanmore....,The War of the Worlds_17
36,,The War of the Worlds_17
36,It was with the greatest difficulty they could get her down to the,The War of the Worlds_17
36,"beach, where presently my brother succeeded in attracting the attention",The War of the Worlds_17
36,of some men on a paddle steamer from the Thames. They sent a boat and,The War of the Worlds_17
36,drove a bargain for thirty-six pounds for the three. The steamer was,The War of the Worlds_17
36,"going, these men said, to Ostend.",The War of the Worlds_17
36,,The War of the Worlds_17
36,"It was about two o’clock when my brother, having paid their fares at",The War of the Worlds_17
36,"the gangway, found himself safely aboard the steamboat with his",The War of the Worlds_17
36,"charges. There was food aboard, albeit at exorbitant prices, and the",The War of the Worlds_17
36,three of them contrived to eat a meal on one of the seats forward.,The War of the Worlds_17
36,,The War of the Worlds_17
36,"There were already a couple of score of passengers aboard, some of whom",The War of the Worlds_17
36,"had expended their last money in securing a passage, but the captain",The War of the Worlds_17
36,"lay off the Blackwater until five in the afternoon, picking up",The War of the Worlds_17
36,passengers until the seated decks were even dangerously crowded. He,The War of the Worlds_17
36,would probably have remained longer had it not been for the sound of,The War of the Worlds_17
36,"guns that began about that hour in the south. As if in answer, the",The War of the Worlds_17
36,ironclad seaward fired a small gun and hoisted a string of flags. A jet,The War of the Worlds_17
36,of smoke sprang out of her funnels.,The War of the Worlds_17
36,,The War of the Worlds_17
36,Some of the passengers were of opinion that this firing came from,The War of the Worlds_17
36,"Shoeburyness, until it was noticed that it was growing louder. At the",The War of the Worlds_17
36,"same time, far away in the southeast the masts and upperworks of three",The War of the Worlds_17
36,"ironclads rose one after the other out of the sea, beneath clouds of",The War of the Worlds_17
36,black smoke. But my brother’s attention speedily reverted to the,The War of the Worlds_17
36,distant firing in the south. He fancied he saw a column of smoke rising,The War of the Worlds_17
36,out of the distant grey haze.,The War of the Worlds_17
36,,The War of the Worlds_17
36,The little steamer was already flapping her way eastward of the big,The War of the Worlds_17
36,"crescent of shipping, and the low Essex coast was growing blue and",The War of the Worlds_17
36,"hazy, when a Martian appeared, small and faint in the remote distance,",The War of the Worlds_17
36,advancing along the muddy coast from the direction of Foulness. At that,The War of the Worlds_17
36,the captain on the bridge swore at the top of his voice with fear and,The War of the Worlds_17
36,"anger at his own delay, and the paddles seemed infected with his",The War of the Worlds_17
36,terror. Every soul aboard stood at the bulwarks or on the seats of the,The War of the Worlds_17
36,"steamer and stared at that distant shape, higher than the trees or",The War of the Worlds_17
36,"church towers inland, and advancing with a leisurely parody of a human",The War of the Worlds_17
36,stride.,The War of the Worlds_17
36,,The War of the Worlds_17
36,"It was the first Martian my brother had seen, and he stood, more amazed",The War of the Worlds_17
36,"than terrified, watching this Titan advancing deliberately towards the",The War of the Worlds_17
36,"shipping, wading farther and farther into the water as the coast fell",The War of the Worlds_17
36,"away. Then, far away beyond the Crouch, came another, striding over",The War of the Worlds_17
36,"some stunted trees, and then yet another, still farther off, wading",The War of the Worlds_17
36,deeply through a shiny mudflat that seemed to hang halfway up between,The War of the Worlds_17
36,"sea and sky. They were all stalking seaward, as if to intercept the",The War of the Worlds_17
36,escape of the multitudinous vessels that were crowded between Foulness,The War of the Worlds_17
36,and the Naze. In spite of the throbbing exertions of the engines of the,The War of the Worlds_17
36,"little paddle-boat, and the pouring foam that her wheels flung behind",The War of the Worlds_17
36,"her, she receded with terrifying slowness from this ominous advance.",The War of the Worlds_17
36,,The War of the Worlds_17
36,"Glancing northwestward, my brother saw the large crescent of shipping",The War of the Worlds_17
36,already writhing with the approaching terror; one ship passing behind,The War of the Worlds_17
36,"another, another coming round from broadside to end on, steamships",The War of the Worlds_17
36,"whistling and giving off volumes of steam, sails being let out,",The War of the Worlds_17
36,launches rushing hither and thither. He was so fascinated by this and,The War of the Worlds_17
36,by the creeping danger away to the left that he had no eyes for,The War of the Worlds_17
36,anything seaward. And then a swift movement of the steamboat (she had,The War of the Worlds_17
36,suddenly come round to avoid being run down) flung him headlong from,The War of the Worlds_17
36,the seat upon which he was standing. There was a shouting all about,The War of the Worlds_17
36,"him, a trampling of feet, and a cheer that seemed to be answered",The War of the Worlds_17
36,faintly. The steamboat lurched and rolled him over upon his hands.,The War of the Worlds_17
36,,The War of the Worlds_17
36,"He sprang to his feet and saw to starboard, and not a hundred yards",The War of the Worlds_17
36,"from their heeling, pitching boat, a vast iron bulk like the blade of a",The War of the Worlds_17
36,"plough tearing through the water, tossing it on either side in huge",The War of the Worlds_17
36,"waves of foam that leaped towards the steamer, flinging her paddles",The War of the Worlds_17
36,"helplessly in the air, and then sucking her deck down almost to the",The War of the Worlds_17
36,waterline.,The War of the Worlds_17
36,,The War of the Worlds_17
36,A douche of spray blinded my brother for a moment. When his eyes were,The War of the Worlds_17
36,clear again he saw the monster had passed and was rushing landward. Big,The War of the Worlds_17
36,"iron upperworks rose out of this headlong structure, and from that twin",The War of the Worlds_17
36,funnels projected and spat a smoking blast shot with fire. It was the,The War of the Worlds_17
36,"torpedo ram, _Thunder Child_, steaming headlong, coming to the rescue",The War of the Worlds_17
36,of the threatened shipping.,The War of the Worlds_17
36,,The War of the Worlds_17
36,"Keeping his footing on the heaving deck by clutching the bulwarks, my",The War of the Worlds_17
36,"brother looked past this charging leviathan at the Martians again, and",The War of the Worlds_17
36,"he saw the three of them now close together, and standing so far out to",The War of the Worlds_17
36,sea that their tripod supports were almost entirely submerged. Thus,The War of the Worlds_17
36,"sunken, and seen in remote perspective, they appeared far less",The War of the Worlds_17
36,formidable than the huge iron bulk in whose wake the steamer was,The War of the Worlds_17
36,pitching so helplessly. It would seem they were regarding this new,The War of the Worlds_17
36,"antagonist with astonishment. To their intelligence, it may be, the",The War of the Worlds_17
36,giant was even such another as themselves. The _Thunder Child_ fired no,The War of the Worlds_17
36,"gun, but simply drove full speed towards them. It was probably her not",The War of the Worlds_17
36,firing that enabled her to get so near the enemy as she did. They did,The War of the Worlds_17
36,"not know what to make of her. One shell, and they would have sent her",The War of the Worlds_17
36,to the bottom forthwith with the Heat-Ray.,The War of the Worlds_17
36,,The War of the Worlds_17
36,She was steaming at such a pace that in a minute she seemed halfway,The War of the Worlds_17
36,between the steamboat and the Martians—a diminishing black bulk against,The War of the Worlds_17
36,the receding horizontal expanse of the Essex coast.,The War of the Worlds_17
36,,The War of the Worlds_17
36,Suddenly the foremost Martian lowered his tube and discharged a,The War of the Worlds_17
36,canister of the black gas at the ironclad. It hit her larboard side and,The War of the Worlds_17
36,"glanced off in an inky jet that rolled away to seaward, an unfolding",The War of the Worlds_17
36,"torrent of Black Smoke, from which the ironclad drove clear. To the",The War of the Worlds_17
36,"watchers from the steamer, low in the water and with the sun in their",The War of the Worlds_17
36,"eyes, it seemed as though she were already among the Martians.",The War of the Worlds_17
36,,The War of the Worlds_17
36,They saw the gaunt figures separating and rising out of the water as,The War of the Worlds_17
36,"they retreated shoreward, and one of them raised the camera-like",The War of the Worlds_17
36,"generator of the Heat-Ray. He held it pointing obliquely downward, and",The War of the Worlds_17
36,a bank of steam sprang from the water at its touch. It must have driven,The War of the Worlds_17
36,through the iron of the ship’s side like a white-hot iron rod through,The War of the Worlds_17
36,paper.,The War of the Worlds_17
36,,The War of the Worlds_17
36,"A flicker of flame went up through the rising steam, and then the",The War of the Worlds_17
36,"Martian reeled and staggered. In another moment he was cut down, and a",The War of the Worlds_17
36,great body of water and steam shot high in the air. The guns of the,The War of the Worlds_17
36,"_Thunder Child_ sounded through the reek, going off one after the",The War of the Worlds_17
36,"other, and one shot splashed the water high close by the steamer,",The War of the Worlds_17
36,"ricocheted towards the other flying ships to the north, and smashed a",The War of the Worlds_17
36,smack to matchwood.,The War of the Worlds_17
36,,The War of the Worlds_17
36,But no one heeded that very much. At the sight of the Martian’s,The War of the Worlds_17
36,"collapse the captain on the bridge yelled inarticulately, and all the",The War of the Worlds_17
36,crowding passengers on the steamer’s stern shouted together. And then,The War of the Worlds_17
36,"they yelled again. For, surging out beyond the white tumult, drove",The War of the Worlds_17
36,"something long and black, the flames streaming from its middle parts,",The War of the Worlds_17
36,its ventilators and funnels spouting fire.,The War of the Worlds_17
36,,The War of the Worlds_17
36,"She was alive still; the steering gear, it seems, was intact and her",The War of the Worlds_17
36,"engines working. She headed straight for a second Martian, and was",The War of the Worlds_17
36,within a hundred yards of him when the Heat-Ray came to bear. Then with,The War of the Worlds_17
36,"a violent thud, a blinding flash, her decks, her funnels, leaped",The War of the Worlds_17
36,"upward. The Martian staggered with the violence of her explosion, and",The War of the Worlds_17
36,"in another moment the flaming wreckage, still driving forward with the",The War of the Worlds_17
36,"impetus of its pace, had struck him and crumpled him up like a thing of",The War of the Worlds_17
36,cardboard. My brother shouted involuntarily. A boiling tumult of steam,The War of the Worlds_17
36,hid everything again.,The War of the Worlds_17
36,,The War of the Worlds_17
36,“Two!” yelled the captain.,The War of the Worlds_17
36,,The War of the Worlds_17
36,Everyone was shouting. The whole steamer from end to end rang with,The War of the Worlds_17
36,frantic cheering that was taken up first by one and then by all in the,The War of the Worlds_17
36,crowding multitude of ships and boats that was driving out to sea.,The War of the Worlds_17
36,,The War of the Worlds_17
36,"The steam hung upon the water for many minutes, hiding the third",The War of the Worlds_17
36,Martian and the coast altogether. And all this time the boat was,The War of the Worlds_17
36,paddling steadily out to sea and away from the fight; and when at last,The War of the Worlds_17
36,"the confusion cleared, the drifting bank of black vapour intervened,",The War of the Worlds_17
36,"and nothing of the _Thunder Child_ could be made out, nor could the",The War of the Worlds_17
36,third Martian be seen. But the ironclads to seaward were now quite,The War of the Worlds_17
36,close and standing in towards shore past the steamboat.,The War of the Worlds_17
36,,The War of the Worlds_17
36,"The little vessel continued to beat its way seaward, and the ironclads",The War of the Worlds_17
36,"receded slowly towards the coast, which was hidden still by a marbled",The War of the Worlds_17
36,"bank of vapour, part steam, part black gas, eddying and combining in",The War of the Worlds_17
36,the strangest way. The fleet of refugees was scattering to the,The War of the Worlds_17
36,northeast; several smacks were sailing between the ironclads and the,The War of the Worlds_17
36,"steamboat. After a time, and before they reached the sinking cloud",The War of the Worlds_17
36,"bank, the warships turned northward, and then abruptly went about and",The War of the Worlds_17
36,passed into the thickening haze of evening southward. The coast grew,The War of the Worlds_17
36,"faint, and at last indistinguishable amid the low banks of clouds that",The War of the Worlds_17
36,were gathering about the sinking sun.,The War of the Worlds_17
36,,The War of the Worlds_17
36,Then suddenly out of the golden haze of the sunset came the vibration,The War of the Worlds_17
36,"of guns, and a form of black shadows moving. Everyone struggled to the",The War of the Worlds_17
36,"rail of the steamer and peered into the blinding furnace of the west,",The War of the Worlds_17
36,but nothing was to be distinguished clearly. A mass of smoke rose,The War of the Worlds_17
36,slanting and barred the face of the sun. The steamboat throbbed on its,The War of the Worlds_17
36,way through an interminable suspense.,The War of the Worlds_17
36,,The War of the Worlds_17
36,"The sun sank into grey clouds, the sky flushed and darkened, the",The War of the Worlds_17
36,evening star trembled into sight. It was deep twilight when the captain,The War of the Worlds_17
36,cried out and pointed. My brother strained his eyes. Something rushed,The War of the Worlds_17
36,up into the sky out of the greyness—rushed slantingly upward and very,The War of the Worlds_17
36,swiftly into the luminous clearness above the clouds in the western,The War of the Worlds_17
36,"sky; something flat and broad, and very large, that swept round in a",The War of the Worlds_17
36,"vast curve, grew smaller, sank slowly, and vanished again into the grey",The War of the Worlds_17
36,mystery of the night. And as it flew it rained down darkness upon the,The War of the Worlds_17

36,In the first book I have wandered so much from my own adventures to,The War of the Worlds_18
36,tell of the experiences of my brother that all through the last two,The War of the Worlds_18
36,chapters I and the curate have been lurking in the empty house at,The War of the Worlds_18
36,Halliford whither we fled to escape the Black Smoke. There I will,The War of the Worlds_18
36,resume. We stopped there all Sunday night and all the next day—the day,The War of the Worlds_18
36,"of the panic—in a little island of daylight, cut off by the Black Smoke",The War of the Worlds_18
36,from the rest of the world. We could do nothing but wait in aching,The War of the Worlds_18
36,inactivity during those two weary days.,The War of the Worlds_18
36,,The War of the Worlds_18
36,My mind was occupied by anxiety for my wife. I figured her at,The War of the Worlds_18
36,"Leatherhead, terrified, in danger, mourning me already as a dead man. I",The War of the Worlds_18
36,paced the rooms and cried aloud when I thought of how I was cut off,The War of the Worlds_18
36,"from her, of all that might happen to her in my absence. My cousin I",The War of the Worlds_18
36,"knew was brave enough for any emergency, but he was not the sort of man",The War of the Worlds_18
36,"to realise danger quickly, to rise promptly. What was needed now was",The War of the Worlds_18
36,"not bravery, but circumspection. My only consolation was to believe",The War of the Worlds_18
36,that the Martians were moving Londonward and away from her. Such vague,The War of the Worlds_18
36,anxieties keep the mind sensitive and painful. I grew very weary and,The War of the Worlds_18
36,irritable with the curate’s perpetual ejaculations; I tired of the,The War of the Worlds_18
36,sight of his selfish despair. After some ineffectual remonstrance I,The War of the Worlds_18
36,"kept away from him, staying in a room—evidently a children’s",The War of the Worlds_18
36,"schoolroom—containing globes, forms, and copybooks. When he followed me",The War of the Worlds_18
36,"thither, I went to a box room at the top of the house and, in order to",The War of the Worlds_18
36,"be alone with my aching miseries, locked myself in.",The War of the Worlds_18
36,,The War of the Worlds_18
36,We were hopelessly hemmed in by the Black Smoke all that day and the,The War of the Worlds_18
36,morning of the next. There were signs of people in the next house on,The War of the Worlds_18
36,"Sunday evening—a face at a window and moving lights, and later the",The War of the Worlds_18
36,"slamming of a door. But I do not know who these people were, nor what",The War of the Worlds_18
36,became of them. We saw nothing of them next day. The Black Smoke,The War of the Worlds_18
36,"drifted slowly riverward all through Monday morning, creeping nearer",The War of the Worlds_18
36,"and nearer to us, driving at last along the roadway outside the house",The War of the Worlds_18
36,that hid us.,The War of the Worlds_18
36,,The War of the Worlds_18
36,"A Martian came across the fields about midday, laying the stuff with a",The War of the Worlds_18
36,"jet of superheated steam that hissed against the walls, smashed all the",The War of the Worlds_18
36,"windows it touched, and scalded the curate’s hand as he fled out of the",The War of the Worlds_18
36,front room. When at last we crept across the sodden rooms and looked,The War of the Worlds_18
36,"out again, the country northward was as though a black snowstorm had",The War of the Worlds_18
36,"passed over it. Looking towards the river, we were astonished to see an",The War of the Worlds_18
36,unaccountable redness mingling with the black of the scorched meadows.,The War of the Worlds_18
36,,The War of the Worlds_18
36,"For a time we did not see how this change affected our position, save",The War of the Worlds_18
36,that we were relieved of our fear of the Black Smoke. But later I,The War of the Worlds_18
36,"perceived that we were no longer hemmed in, that now we might get away.",The War of the Worlds_18
36,"So soon as I realised that the way of escape was open, my dream of",The War of the Worlds_18
36,"action returned. But the curate was lethargic, unreasonable.",The War of the Worlds_18
36,,The War of the Worlds_18
36,"“We are safe here,” he repeated; “safe here.”",The War of the Worlds_18
36,,The War of the Worlds_18
36,I resolved to leave him—would that I had! Wiser now for the,The War of the Worlds_18
36,"artilleryman’s teaching, I sought out food and drink. I had found oil",The War of the Worlds_18
36,"and rags for my burns, and I also took a hat and a flannel shirt that I",The War of the Worlds_18
36,found in one of the bedrooms. When it was clear to him that I meant to,The War of the Worlds_18
36,go alone—had reconciled myself to going alone—he suddenly roused,The War of the Worlds_18
36,"himself to come. And all being quiet throughout the afternoon, we",The War of the Worlds_18
36,"started about five o’clock, as I should judge, along the blackened road",The War of the Worlds_18
36,to Sunbury.,The War of the Worlds_18
36,,The War of the Worlds_18
36,"In Sunbury, and at intervals along the road, were dead bodies lying in",The War of the Worlds_18
36,"contorted attitudes, horses as well as men, overturned carts and",The War of the Worlds_18
36,"luggage, all covered thickly with black dust. That pall of cindery",The War of the Worlds_18
36,powder made me think of what I had read of the destruction of Pompeii.,The War of the Worlds_18
36,"We got to Hampton Court without misadventure, our minds full of strange",The War of the Worlds_18
36,"and unfamiliar appearances, and at Hampton Court our eyes were relieved",The War of the Worlds_18
36,to find a patch of green that had escaped the suffocating drift. We,The War of the Worlds_18
36,"went through Bushey Park, with its deer going to and fro under the",The War of the Worlds_18
36,"chestnuts, and some men and women hurrying in the distance towards",The War of the Worlds_18
36,"Hampton, and so we came to Twickenham. These were the first people we",The War of the Worlds_18
36,saw.,The War of the Worlds_18
36,,The War of the Worlds_18
36,Away across the road the woods beyond Ham and Petersham were still,The War of the Worlds_18
36,"afire. Twickenham was uninjured by either Heat-Ray or Black Smoke, and",The War of the Worlds_18
36,"there were more people about here, though none could give us news. For",The War of the Worlds_18
36,"the most part they were like ourselves, taking advantage of a lull to",The War of the Worlds_18
36,shift their quarters. I have an impression that many of the houses here,The War of the Worlds_18
36,"were still occupied by scared inhabitants, too frightened even for",The War of the Worlds_18
36,flight. Here too the evidence of a hasty rout was abundant along the,The War of the Worlds_18
36,"road. I remember most vividly three smashed bicycles in a heap, pounded",The War of the Worlds_18
36,into the road by the wheels of subsequent carts. We crossed Richmond,The War of the Worlds_18
36,"Bridge about half past eight. We hurried across the exposed bridge, of",The War of the Worlds_18
36,"course, but I noticed floating down the stream a number of red masses,",The War of the Worlds_18
36,some many feet across. I did not know what these were—there was no time,The War of the Worlds_18
36,for scrutiny—and I put a more horrible interpretation on them than they,The War of the Worlds_18
36,deserved. Here again on the Surrey side were black dust that had once,The War of the Worlds_18
36,"been smoke, and dead bodies—a heap near the approach to the station;",The War of the Worlds_18
36,but we had no glimpse of the Martians until we were some way towards,The War of the Worlds_18
36,Barnes.,The War of the Worlds_18
36,,The War of the Worlds_18
36,We saw in the blackened distance a group of three people running down a,The War of the Worlds_18
36,"side street towards the river, but otherwise it seemed deserted. Up the",The War of the Worlds_18
36,hill Richmond town was burning briskly; outside the town of Richmond,The War of the Worlds_18
36,there was no trace of the Black Smoke.,The War of the Worlds_18
36,,The War of the Worlds_18
36,"Then suddenly, as we approached Kew, came a number of people running,",The War of the Worlds_18
36,and the upperworks of a Martian fighting-machine loomed in sight over,The War of the Worlds_18
36,"the housetops, not a hundred yards away from us. We stood aghast at our",The War of the Worlds_18
36,"danger, and had the Martian looked down we must immediately have",The War of the Worlds_18
36,"perished. We were so terrified that we dared not go on, but turned",The War of the Worlds_18
36,"aside and hid in a shed in a garden. There the curate crouched, weeping",The War of the Worlds_18
36,"silently, and refusing to stir again.",The War of the Worlds_18
36,,The War of the Worlds_18
36,"But my fixed idea of reaching Leatherhead would not let me rest, and in",The War of the Worlds_18
36,"the twilight I ventured out again. I went through a shrubbery, and",The War of the Worlds_18
36,"along a passage beside a big house standing in its own grounds, and so",The War of the Worlds_18
36,"emerged upon the road towards Kew. The curate I left in the shed, but",The War of the Worlds_18
36,he came hurrying after me.,The War of the Worlds_18
36,,The War of the Worlds_18
36,That second start was the most foolhardy thing I ever did. For it was,The War of the Worlds_18
36,manifest the Martians were about us. No sooner had the curate overtaken,The War of the Worlds_18
36,me than we saw either the fighting-machine we had seen before or,The War of the Worlds_18
36,"another, far away across the meadows in the direction of Kew Lodge.",The War of the Worlds_18
36,Four or five little black figures hurried before it across the,The War of the Worlds_18
36,"green-grey of the field, and in a moment it was evident this Martian",The War of the Worlds_18
36,"pursued them. In three strides he was among them, and they ran",The War of the Worlds_18
36,radiating from his feet in all directions. He used no Heat-Ray to,The War of the Worlds_18
36,"destroy them, but picked them up one by one. Apparently he tossed them",The War of the Worlds_18
36,"into the great metallic carrier which projected behind him, much as a",The War of the Worlds_18
36,workman’s basket hangs over his shoulder.,The War of the Worlds_18
36,,The War of the Worlds_18
36,It was the first time I realised that the Martians might have any other,The War of the Worlds_18
36,purpose than destruction with defeated humanity. We stood for a moment,The War of the Worlds_18
36,"petrified, then turned and fled through a gate behind us into a walled",The War of the Worlds_18
36,"garden, fell into, rather than found, a fortunate ditch, and lay there,",The War of the Worlds_18
36,scarce daring to whisper to each other until the stars were out.,The War of the Worlds_18
36,,The War of the Worlds_18
36,I suppose it was nearly eleven o’clock before we gathered courage to,The War of the Worlds_18
36,"start again, no longer venturing into the road, but sneaking along",The War of the Worlds_18
36,"hedgerows and through plantations, and watching keenly through the",The War of the Worlds_18
36,"darkness, he on the right and I on the left, for the Martians, who",The War of the Worlds_18
36,seemed to be all about us. In one place we blundered upon a scorched,The War of the Worlds_18
36,"and blackened area, now cooling and ashen, and a number of scattered",The War of the Worlds_18
36,"dead bodies of men, burned horribly about the heads and trunks but with",The War of the Worlds_18
36,"their legs and boots mostly intact; and of dead horses, fifty feet,",The War of the Worlds_18
36,"perhaps, behind a line of four ripped guns and smashed gun carriages.",The War of the Worlds_18
36,,The War of the Worlds_18
36,"Sheen, it seemed, had escaped destruction, but the place was silent and",The War of the Worlds_18
36,"deserted. Here we happened on no dead, though the night was too dark",The War of the Worlds_18
36,for us to see into the side roads of the place. In Sheen my companion,The War of the Worlds_18
36,"suddenly complained of faintness and thirst, and we decided to try one",The War of the Worlds_18
36,of the houses.,The War of the Worlds_18
36,,The War of the Worlds_18
36,"The first house we entered, after a little difficulty with the window,",The War of the Worlds_18
36,"was a small semi-detached villa, and I found nothing eatable left in",The War of the Worlds_18
36,"the place but some mouldy cheese. There was, however, water to drink;",The War of the Worlds_18
36,"and I took a hatchet, which promised to be useful in our next",The War of the Worlds_18
36,house-breaking.,The War of the Worlds_18
36,,The War of the Worlds_18
36,We then crossed to a place where the road turns towards Mortlake. Here,The War of the Worlds_18
36,"there stood a white house within a walled garden, and in the pantry of",The War of the Worlds_18
36,"this domicile we found a store of food—two loaves of bread in a pan, an",The War of the Worlds_18
36,"uncooked steak, and the half of a ham. I give this catalogue so",The War of the Worlds_18
36,"precisely because, as it happened, we were destined to subsist upon",The War of the Worlds_18
36,"this store for the next fortnight. Bottled beer stood under a shelf,",The War of the Worlds_18
36,and there were two bags of haricot beans and some limp lettuces. This,The War of the Worlds_18
36,"pantry opened into a kind of wash-up kitchen, and in this was firewood;",The War of the Worlds_18
36,"there was also a cupboard, in which we found nearly a dozen of",The War of the Worlds_18
36,"burgundy, tinned soups and salmon, and two tins of biscuits.",The War of the Worlds_18
36,,The War of the Worlds_18
36,We sat in the adjacent kitchen in the dark—for we dared not strike a,The War of the Worlds_18
36,"light—and ate bread and ham, and drank beer out of the same bottle. The",The War of the Worlds_18
36,"curate, who was still timorous and restless, was now, oddly enough, for",The War of the Worlds_18
36,"pushing on, and I was urging him to keep up his strength by eating when",The War of the Worlds_18
36,the thing happened that was to imprison us.,The War of the Worlds_18
36,,The War of the Worlds_18
36,"“It can’t be midnight yet,” I said, and then came a blinding glare of",The War of the Worlds_18
36,"vivid green light. Everything in the kitchen leaped out, clearly",The War of the Worlds_18
36,"visible in green and black, and vanished again. And then followed such",The War of the Worlds_18
36,a concussion as I have never heard before or since. So close on the,The War of the Worlds_18
36,"heels of this as to seem instantaneous came a thud behind me, a clash",The War of the Worlds_18
36,"of glass, a crash and rattle of falling masonry all about us, and the",The War of the Worlds_18
36,"plaster of the ceiling came down upon us, smashing into a multitude of",The War of the Worlds_18
36,fragments upon our heads. I was knocked headlong across the floor,The War of the Worlds_18
36,"against the oven handle and stunned. I was insensible for a long time,",The War of the Worlds_18
36,"the curate told me, and when I came to we were in darkness again, and",The War of the Worlds_18
36,"he, with a face wet, as I found afterwards, with blood from a cut",The War of the Worlds_18
36,"forehead, was dabbing water over me.",The War of the Worlds_18
36,,The War of the Worlds_18
36,For some time I could not recollect what had happened. Then things came,The War of the Worlds_18
36,to me slowly. A bruise on my temple asserted itself.,The War of the Worlds_18
36,,The War of the Worlds_18
36,“Are you better?” asked the curate in a whisper.,The War of the Worlds_18
36,,The War of the Worlds_18
36,At last I answered him. I sat up.,The War of the Worlds_18
36,,The War of the Worlds_18
36,"“Don’t move,” he said. “The floor is covered with smashed crockery from",The War of the Worlds_18
36,"the dresser. You can’t possibly move without making a noise, and I",The War of the Worlds_18
36,fancy _they_ are outside.”,The War of the Worlds_18
36,,The War of the Worlds_18
36,"We both sat quite silent, so that we could scarcely hear each other",The War of the Worlds_18
36,"breathing. Everything seemed deadly still, but once something near us,",The War of the Worlds_18
36,"some plaster or broken brickwork, slid down with a rumbling sound.",The War of the Worlds_18
36,"Outside and very near was an intermittent, metallic rattle.",The War of the Worlds_18
36,,The War of the Worlds_18
36,"“That!” said the curate, when presently it happened again.",The War of the Worlds_18
36,,The War of the Worlds_18
36,"“Yes,” I said. “But what is it?”",The War of the Worlds_18
36,,The War of the Worlds_18
36,“A Martian!” said the curate.,The War of the Worlds_18
36,,The War of the Worlds_18
36,I listened again.,The War of the Worlds_18
36,,The War of the Worlds_18
36,"“It was not like the Heat-Ray,” I said, and for a time I was inclined",The War of the Worlds_18
36,to think one of the great fighting-machines had stumbled against the,The War of the Worlds_18
36,"house, as I had seen one stumble against the tower of Shepperton",The War of the Worlds_18
36,Church.,The War of the Worlds_18
36,,The War of the Worlds_18
36,Our situation was so strange and incomprehensible that for three or,The War of the Worlds_18
36,"four hours, until the dawn came, we scarcely moved. And then the light",The War of the Worlds_18
36,"filtered in, not through the window, which remained black, but through",The War of the Worlds_18
36,a triangular aperture between a beam and a heap of broken bricks in the,The War of the Worlds_18
36,wall behind us. The interior of the kitchen we now saw greyly for the,The War of the Worlds_18
36,first time.,The War of the Worlds_18
36,,The War of the Worlds_18
36,"The window had been burst in by a mass of garden mould, which flowed",The War of the Worlds_18
36,over the table upon which we had been sitting and lay about our feet.,The War of the Worlds_18
36,"Outside, the soil was banked high against the house. At the top of the",The War of the Worlds_18
36,window frame we could see an uprooted drainpipe. The floor was littered,The War of the Worlds_18
36,with smashed hardware; the end of the kitchen towards the house was,The War of the Worlds_18
36,"broken into, and since the daylight shone in there, it was evident the",The War of the Worlds_18
36,greater part of the house had collapsed. Contrasting vividly with this,The War of the Worlds_18
36,"ruin was the neat dresser, stained in the fashion, pale green, and with",The War of the Worlds_18
36,"a number of copper and tin vessels below it, the wallpaper imitating",The War of the Worlds_18
36,"blue and white tiles, and a couple of coloured supplements fluttering",The War of the Worlds_18
36,from the walls above the kitchen range.,The War of the Worlds_18
36,,The War of the Worlds_18
36,"As the dawn grew clearer, we saw through the gap in the wall the body",The War of the Worlds_18
36,"of a Martian, standing sentinel, I suppose, over the still glowing",The War of the Worlds_18
36,cylinder. At the sight of that we crawled as circumspectly as possible,The War of the Worlds_18
36,out of the twilight of the kitchen into the darkness of the scullery.,The War of the Worlds_18
36,,The War of the Worlds_18
36,Abruptly the right interpretation dawned upon my mind.,The War of the Worlds_18
36,,The War of the Worlds_18
36,"“The fifth cylinder,” I whispered, “the fifth shot from Mars, has",The War of the Worlds_18
36,struck this house and buried us under the ruins!”,The War of the Worlds_18
36,,The War of the Worlds_18
36,"For a time the curate was silent, and then he whispered:",The War of the Worlds_18
36,,The War of the Worlds_18
36,“God have mercy upon us!”,The War of the Worlds_18
36,,The War of the Worlds_18
36,I heard him presently whimpering to himself.,The War of the Worlds_18
36,,The War of the Worlds_18
36,Save for that sound we lay quite still in the scullery; I for my part,The War of the Worlds_18
36,"scarce dared breathe, and sat with my eyes fixed on the faint light of",The War of the Worlds_18
36,"the kitchen door. I could just see the curate’s face, a dim, oval",The War of the Worlds_18
36,"shape, and his collar and cuffs. Outside there began a metallic",The War of the Worlds_18
36,"hammering, then a violent hooting, and then again, after a quiet",The War of the Worlds_18
36,"interval, a hissing like the hissing of an engine. These noises, for",The War of the Worlds_18
36,"the most part problematical, continued intermittently, and seemed if",The War of the Worlds_18
36,anything to increase in number as time wore on. Presently a measured,The War of the Worlds_18
36,thudding and a vibration that made everything about us quiver and the,The War of the Worlds_18
36,"vessels in the pantry ring and shift, began and continued. Once the",The War of the Worlds_18
36,"light was eclipsed, and the ghostly kitchen doorway became absolutely",The War of the Worlds_18
36,"dark. For many hours we must have crouched there, silent and shivering,",The War of the Worlds_18
36,until our tired attention failed. . . .,The War of the Worlds_18
36,,The War of the Worlds_18
36,At last I found myself awake and very hungry. I am inclined to believe,The War of the Worlds_18
36,we must have spent the greater portion of a day before that awakening.,The War of the Worlds_18
36,My hunger was at a stride so insistent that it moved me to action. I,The War of the Worlds_18
36,"told the curate I was going to seek food, and felt my way towards the",The War of the Worlds_18
36,"pantry. He made me no answer, but so soon as I began eating the faint",The War of the Worlds_18
36,noise I made stirred him up and I heard him crawling after me.,The War of the Worlds_18
36,,The War of the Worlds_18

36,II.,The War of the Worlds_19
36,WHAT WE SAW FROM THE RUINED HOUSE.,The War of the Worlds_19
36,,The War of the Worlds_19
36,,The War of the Worlds_19
36,"After eating we crept back to the scullery, and there I must have dozed",The War of the Worlds_19
36,"again, for when presently I looked round I was alone. The thudding",The War of the Worlds_19
36,vibration continued with wearisome persistence. I whispered for the,The War of the Worlds_19
36,"curate several times, and at last felt my way to the door of the",The War of the Worlds_19
36,"kitchen. It was still daylight, and I perceived him across the room,",The War of the Worlds_19
36,lying against the triangular hole that looked out upon the Martians.,The War of the Worlds_19
36,"His shoulders were hunched, so that his head was hidden from me.",The War of the Worlds_19
36,,The War of the Worlds_19
36,I could hear a number of noises almost like those in an engine shed;,The War of the Worlds_19
36,and the place rocked with that beating thud. Through the aperture in,The War of the Worlds_19
36,the wall I could see the top of a tree touched with gold and the warm,The War of the Worlds_19
36,blue of a tranquil evening sky. For a minute or so I remained watching,The War of the Worlds_19
36,"the curate, and then I advanced, crouching and stepping with extreme",The War of the Worlds_19
36,care amid the broken crockery that littered the floor.,The War of the Worlds_19
36,,The War of the Worlds_19
36,"I touched the curate’s leg, and he started so violently that a mass of",The War of the Worlds_19
36,plaster went sliding down outside and fell with a loud impact. I,The War of the Worlds_19
36,"gripped his arm, fearing he might cry out, and for a long time we",The War of the Worlds_19
36,crouched motionless. Then I turned to see how much of our rampart,The War of the Worlds_19
36,remained. The detachment of the plaster had left a vertical slit open,The War of the Worlds_19
36,"in the debris, and by raising myself cautiously across a beam I was",The War of the Worlds_19
36,able to see out of this gap into what had been overnight a quiet,The War of the Worlds_19
36,"suburban roadway. Vast, indeed, was the change that we beheld.",The War of the Worlds_19
36,,The War of the Worlds_19
36,The fifth cylinder must have fallen right into the midst of the house,The War of the Worlds_19
36,"we had first visited. The building had vanished, completely smashed,",The War of the Worlds_19
36,"pulverised, and dispersed by the blow. The cylinder lay now far beneath",The War of the Worlds_19
36,"the original foundations—deep in a hole, already vastly larger than the",The War of the Worlds_19
36,pit I had looked into at Woking. The earth all round it had splashed,The War of the Worlds_19
36,under that tremendous impact—“splashed” is the only word—and lay in,The War of the Worlds_19
36,heaped piles that hid the masses of the adjacent houses. It had behaved,The War of the Worlds_19
36,exactly like mud under the violent blow of a hammer. Our house had,The War of the Worlds_19
36,"collapsed backward; the front portion, even on the ground floor, had",The War of the Worlds_19
36,been destroyed completely; by a chance the kitchen and scullery had,The War of the Worlds_19
36,"escaped, and stood buried now under soil and ruins, closed in by tons",The War of the Worlds_19
36,of earth on every side save towards the cylinder. Over that aspect we,The War of the Worlds_19
36,hung now on the very edge of the great circular pit the Martians were,The War of the Worlds_19
36,engaged in making. The heavy beating sound was evidently just behind,The War of the Worlds_19
36,"us, and ever and again a bright green vapour drove up like a veil",The War of the Worlds_19
36,across our peephole.,The War of the Worlds_19
36,,The War of the Worlds_19
36,"The cylinder was already opened in the centre of the pit, and on the",The War of the Worlds_19
36,"farther edge of the pit, amid the smashed and gravel-heaped shrubbery,",The War of the Worlds_19
36,"one of the great fighting-machines, deserted by its occupant, stood",The War of the Worlds_19
36,stiff and tall against the evening sky. At first I scarcely noticed the,The War of the Worlds_19
36,"pit and the cylinder, although it has been convenient to describe them",The War of the Worlds_19
36,"first, on account of the extraordinary glittering mechanism I saw busy",The War of the Worlds_19
36,"in the excavation, and on account of the strange creatures that were",The War of the Worlds_19
36,crawling slowly and painfully across the heaped mould near it.,The War of the Worlds_19
36,,The War of the Worlds_19
36,The mechanism it certainly was that held my attention first. It was one,The War of the Worlds_19
36,of those complicated fabrics that have since been called,The War of the Worlds_19
36,"handling-machines, and the study of which has already given such an",The War of the Worlds_19
36,"enormous impetus to terrestrial invention. As it dawned upon me first,",The War of the Worlds_19
36,"it presented a sort of metallic spider with five jointed, agile legs,",The War of the Worlds_19
36,"and with an extraordinary number of jointed levers, bars, and reaching",The War of the Worlds_19
36,and clutching tentacles about its body. Most of its arms were,The War of the Worlds_19
36,"retracted, but with three long tentacles it was fishing out a number of",The War of the Worlds_19
36,"rods, plates, and bars which lined the covering and apparently",The War of the Worlds_19
36,"strengthened the walls of the cylinder. These, as it extracted them,",The War of the Worlds_19
36,were lifted out and deposited upon a level surface of earth behind it.,The War of the Worlds_19
36,,The War of the Worlds_19
36,"Its motion was so swift, complex, and perfect that at first I did not",The War of the Worlds_19
36,"see it as a machine, in spite of its metallic glitter. The",The War of the Worlds_19
36,fighting-machines were coordinated and animated to an extraordinary,The War of the Worlds_19
36,"pitch, but nothing to compare with this. People who have never seen",The War of the Worlds_19
36,"these structures, and have only the ill-imagined efforts of artists or",The War of the Worlds_19
36,"the imperfect descriptions of such eye-witnesses as myself to go upon,",The War of the Worlds_19
36,scarcely realise that living quality.,The War of the Worlds_19
36,,The War of the Worlds_19
36,I recall particularly the illustration of one of the first pamphlets to,The War of the Worlds_19
36,give a consecutive account of the war. The artist had evidently made a,The War of the Worlds_19
36,"hasty study of one of the fighting-machines, and there his knowledge",The War of the Worlds_19
36,"ended. He presented them as tilted, stiff tripods, without either",The War of the Worlds_19
36,"flexibility or subtlety, and with an altogether misleading monotony of",The War of the Worlds_19
36,effect. The pamphlet containing these renderings had a considerable,The War of the Worlds_19
36,"vogue, and I mention them here simply to warn the reader against the",The War of the Worlds_19
36,impression they may have created. They were no more like the Martians I,The War of the Worlds_19
36,"saw in action than a Dutch doll is like a human being. To my mind, the",The War of the Worlds_19
36,pamphlet would have been much better without them.,The War of the Worlds_19
36,,The War of the Worlds_19
36,"At first, I say, the handling-machine did not impress me as a machine,",The War of the Worlds_19
36,"but as a crablike creature with a glittering integument, the",The War of the Worlds_19
36,controlling Martian whose delicate tentacles actuated its movements,The War of the Worlds_19
36,seeming to be simply the equivalent of the crab’s cerebral portion. But,The War of the Worlds_19
36,"then I perceived the resemblance of its grey-brown, shiny, leathery",The War of the Worlds_19
36,"integument to that of the other sprawling bodies beyond, and the true",The War of the Worlds_19
36,nature of this dexterous workman dawned upon me. With that realisation,The War of the Worlds_19
36,"my interest shifted to those other creatures, the real Martians.",The War of the Worlds_19
36,"Already I had had a transient impression of these, and the first nausea",The War of the Worlds_19
36,"no longer obscured my observation. Moreover, I was concealed and",The War of the Worlds_19
36,"motionless, and under no urgency of action.",The War of the Worlds_19
36,,The War of the Worlds_19
36,"They were, I now saw, the most unearthly creatures it is possible to",The War of the Worlds_19
36,"conceive. They were huge round bodies—or, rather, heads—about four feet",The War of the Worlds_19
36,"in diameter, each body having in front of it a face. This face had no",The War of the Worlds_19
36,"nostrils—indeed, the Martians do not seem to have had any sense of",The War of the Worlds_19
36,"smell, but it had a pair of very large dark-coloured eyes, and just",The War of the Worlds_19
36,beneath this a kind of fleshy beak. In the back of this head or body—I,The War of the Worlds_19
36,"scarcely know how to speak of it—was the single tight tympanic surface,",The War of the Worlds_19
36,"since known to be anatomically an ear, though it must have been almost",The War of the Worlds_19
36,useless in our dense air. In a group round the mouth were sixteen,The War of the Worlds_19
36,"slender, almost whiplike tentacles, arranged in two bunches of eight",The War of the Worlds_19
36,"each. These bunches have since been named rather aptly, by that",The War of the Worlds_19
36,"distinguished anatomist, Professor Howes, the _hands_. Even as I saw",The War of the Worlds_19
36,these Martians for the first time they seemed to be endeavouring to,The War of the Worlds_19
36,"raise themselves on these hands, but of course, with the increased",The War of the Worlds_19
36,"weight of terrestrial conditions, this was impossible. There is reason",The War of the Worlds_19
36,to suppose that on Mars they may have progressed upon them with some,The War of the Worlds_19
36,facility.,The War of the Worlds_19
36,,The War of the Worlds_19
36,"The internal anatomy, I may remark here, as dissection has since shown,",The War of the Worlds_19
36,was almost equally simple. The greater part of the structure was the,The War of the Worlds_19
36,"brain, sending enormous nerves to the eyes, ear, and tactile tentacles.",The War of the Worlds_19
36,"Besides this were the bulky lungs, into which the mouth opened, and the",The War of the Worlds_19
36,heart and its vessels. The pulmonary distress caused by the denser,The War of the Worlds_19
36,atmosphere and greater gravitational attraction was only too evident in,The War of the Worlds_19
36,the convulsive movements of the outer skin.,The War of the Worlds_19
36,,The War of the Worlds_19
36,And this was the sum of the Martian organs. Strange as it may seem to a,The War of the Worlds_19
36,"human being, all the complex apparatus of digestion, which makes up the",The War of the Worlds_19
36,"bulk of our bodies, did not exist in the Martians. They were",The War of the Worlds_19
36,"heads—merely heads. Entrails they had none. They did not eat, much less",The War of the Worlds_19
36,"digest. Instead, they took the fresh, living blood of other creatures,",The War of the Worlds_19
36,and _injected_ it into their own veins. I have myself seen this being,The War of the Worlds_19
36,"done, as I shall mention in its place. But, squeamish as I may seem, I",The War of the Worlds_19
36,cannot bring myself to describe what I could not endure even to,The War of the Worlds_19
36,"continue watching. Let it suffice to say, blood obtained from a still",The War of the Worlds_19
36,"living animal, in most cases from a human being, was run directly by",The War of the Worlds_19
36,means of a little pipette into the recipient canal. . . .,The War of the Worlds_19
36,,The War of the Worlds_19
36,"The bare idea of this is no doubt horribly repulsive to us, but at the",The War of the Worlds_19
36,same time I think that we should remember how repulsive our carnivorous,The War of the Worlds_19
36,habits would seem to an intelligent rabbit.,The War of the Worlds_19
36,,The War of the Worlds_19
36,The physiological advantages of the practice of injection are,The War of the Worlds_19
36,"undeniable, if one thinks of the tremendous waste of human time and",The War of the Worlds_19
36,energy occasioned by eating and the digestive process. Our bodies are,The War of the Worlds_19
36,"half made up of glands and tubes and organs, occupied in turning",The War of the Worlds_19
36,heterogeneous food into blood. The digestive processes and their,The War of the Worlds_19
36,reaction upon the nervous system sap our strength and colour our minds.,The War of the Worlds_19
36,"Men go happy or miserable as they have healthy or unhealthy livers, or",The War of the Worlds_19
36,sound gastric glands. But the Martians were lifted above all these,The War of the Worlds_19
36,organic fluctuations of mood and emotion.,The War of the Worlds_19
36,,The War of the Worlds_19
36,Their undeniable preference for men as their source of nourishment is,The War of the Worlds_19
36,partly explained by the nature of the remains of the victims they had,The War of the Worlds_19
36,"brought with them as provisions from Mars. These creatures, to judge",The War of the Worlds_19
36,"from the shrivelled remains that have fallen into human hands, were",The War of the Worlds_19
36,"bipeds with flimsy, silicious skeletons (almost like those of the",The War of the Worlds_19
36,"silicious sponges) and feeble musculature, standing about six feet high",The War of the Worlds_19
36,"and having round, erect heads, and large eyes in flinty sockets. Two or",The War of the Worlds_19
36,"three of these seem to have been brought in each cylinder, and all were",The War of the Worlds_19
36,"killed before earth was reached. It was just as well for them, for the",The War of the Worlds_19
36,mere attempt to stand upright upon our planet would have broken every,The War of the Worlds_19
36,bone in their bodies.,The War of the Worlds_19
36,,The War of the Worlds_19
36,"And while I am engaged in this description, I may add in this place",The War of the Worlds_19
36,"certain further details which, although they were not all evident to us",The War of the Worlds_19

36,"of fatigue, it would seem. On earth they could never have moved without",The War of the Worlds_19
36,"effort, yet even to the last they kept in action. In twenty-four hours",The War of the Worlds_19

36,"Apparently the vegetable kingdom in Mars, instead of having green for a",The War of the Worlds_19
36,"dominant colour, is of a vivid blood-red tint. At any rate, the seeds",The War of the Worlds_19
36,which the Martians (intentionally or accidentally) brought with them,The War of the Worlds_19
36,gave rise in all cases to red-coloured growths. Only that known,The War of the Worlds_19
36,"popularly as the red weed, however, gained any footing in competition",The War of the Worlds_19
36,"with terrestrial forms. The red creeper was quite a transitory growth,",The War of the Worlds_19
36,"and few people have seen it growing. For a time, however, the red weed",The War of the Worlds_19
36,grew with astonishing vigour and luxuriance. It spread up the sides of,The War of the Worlds_19
36,"the pit by the third or fourth day of our imprisonment, and its",The War of the Worlds_19
36,cactus-like branches formed a carmine fringe to the edges of our,The War of the Worlds_19
36,triangular window. And afterwards I found it broadcast throughout the,The War of the Worlds_19
36,"country, and especially wherever there was a stream of water.",The War of the Worlds_19
36,,The War of the Worlds_19
36,"The Martians had what appears to have been an auditory organ, a single",The War of the Worlds_19
36,"round drum at the back of the head-body, and eyes with a visual range",The War of the Worlds_19
36,"not very different from ours except that, according to Philips, blue",The War of the Worlds_19
36,and violet were as black to them. It is commonly supposed that they,The War of the Worlds_19
36,"communicated by sounds and tentacular gesticulations; this is asserted,",The War of the Worlds_19
36,"for instance, in the able but hastily compiled pamphlet (written",The War of the Worlds_19
36,evidently by someone not an eye-witness of Martian actions) to which I,The War of the Worlds_19
36,"have already alluded, and which, so far, has been the chief source of",The War of the Worlds_19
36,information concerning them. Now no surviving human being saw so much,The War of the Worlds_19
36,of the Martians in action as I did. I take no credit to myself for an,The War of the Worlds_19
36,"accident, but the fact is so. And I assert that I watched them closely",The War of the Worlds_19
36,"time after time, and that I have seen four, five, and (once) six of",The War of the Worlds_19
36,them sluggishly performing the most elaborately complicated operations,The War of the Worlds_19
36,together without either sound or gesture. Their peculiar hooting,The War of the Worlds_19
36,"invariably preceded feeding; it had no modulation, and was, I believe,",The War of the Worlds_19
36,"in no sense a signal, but merely the expiration of air preparatory to",The War of the Worlds_19
36,the suctional operation. I have a certain claim to at least an,The War of the Worlds_19
36,"elementary knowledge of psychology, and in this matter I am",The War of the Worlds_19
36,convinced—as firmly as I am convinced of anything—that the Martians,The War of the Worlds_19
36,interchanged thoughts without any physical intermediation. And I have,The War of the Worlds_19
36,been convinced of this in spite of strong preconceptions. Before the,The War of the Worlds_19
36,"Martian invasion, as an occasional reader here or there may remember, I",The War of the Worlds_19
36,had written with some little vehemence against the telepathic theory.,The War of the Worlds_19
36,,The War of the Worlds_19
36,The Martians wore no clothing. Their conceptions of ornament and,The War of the Worlds_19
36,decorum were necessarily different from ours; and not only were they,The War of the Worlds_19
36,"evidently much less sensible of changes of temperature than we are, but",The War of the Worlds_19
36,changes of pressure do not seem to have affected their health at all,The War of the Worlds_19
36,"seriously. Yet though they wore no clothing, it was in the other",The War of the Worlds_19
36,artificial additions to their bodily resources that their great,The War of the Worlds_19
36,"superiority over man lay. We men, with our bicycles and road-skates,",The War of the Worlds_19
36,"our Lilienthal soaring-machines, our guns and sticks and so forth, are",The War of the Worlds_19
36,just in the beginning of the evolution that the Martians have worked,The War of the Worlds_19
36,"out. They have become practically mere brains, wearing different bodies",The War of the Worlds_19
36,according to their needs just as men wear suits of clothes and take a,The War of the Worlds_19
36,"bicycle in a hurry or an umbrella in the wet. And of their appliances,",The War of the Worlds_19
36,perhaps nothing is more wonderful to a man than the curious fact that,The War of the Worlds_19
36,what is the dominant feature of almost all human devices in mechanism,The War of the Worlds_19
36,is absent—the _wheel_ is absent; among all the things they brought to,The War of the Worlds_19
36,earth there is no trace or suggestion of their use of wheels. One would,The War of the Worlds_19
36,have at least expected it in locomotion. And in this connection it is,The War of the Worlds_19
36,curious to remark that even on this earth Nature has never hit upon the,The War of the Worlds_19
36,"wheel, or has preferred other expedients to its development. And not",The War of the Worlds_19
36,"only did the Martians either not know of (which is incredible), or",The War of the Worlds_19
36,"abstain from, the wheel, but in their apparatus singularly little use",The War of the Worlds_19
36,"is made of the fixed pivot or relatively fixed pivot, with circular",The War of the Worlds_19
36,motions thereabout confined to one plane. Almost all the joints of the,The War of the Worlds_19
36,machinery present a complicated system of sliding parts moving over,The War of the Worlds_19
36,small but beautifully curved friction bearings. And while upon this,The War of the Worlds_19
36,"matter of detail, it is remarkable that the long leverages of their",The War of the Worlds_19
36,machines are in most cases actuated by a sort of sham musculature of,The War of the Worlds_19
36,the disks in an elastic sheath; these disks become polarised and drawn,The War of the Worlds_19
36,closely and powerfully together when traversed by a current of,The War of the Worlds_19
36,"electricity. In this way the curious parallelism to animal motions,",The War of the Worlds_19
36,"which was so striking and disturbing to the human beholder, was",The War of the Worlds_19
36,attained. Such quasi-muscles abounded in the crablike handling-machine,The War of the Worlds_19
36,"which, on my first peeping out of the slit, I watched unpacking the",The War of the Worlds_19
36,cylinder. It seemed infinitely more alive than the actual Martians,The War of the Worlds_19
36,"lying beyond it in the sunset light, panting, stirring ineffectual",The War of the Worlds_19
36,"tentacles, and moving feebly after their vast journey across space.",The War of the Worlds_19
36,,The War of the Worlds_19
36,"While I was still watching their sluggish motions in the sunlight, and",The War of the Worlds_19
36,"noting each strange detail of their form, the curate reminded me of his",The War of the Worlds_19
36,"presence by pulling violently at my arm. I turned to a scowling face,",The War of the Worlds_19
36,"and silent, eloquent lips. He wanted the slit, which permitted only one",The War of the Worlds_19
36,of us to peep through; and so I had to forego watching them for a time,The War of the Worlds_19
36,while he enjoyed that privilege.,The War of the Worlds_19
36,,The War of the Worlds_19
36,"When I looked again, the busy handling-machine had already put together",The War of the Worlds_19
36,several of the pieces of apparatus it had taken out of the cylinder,The War of the Worlds_19
36,into a shape having an unmistakable likeness to its own; and down on,The War of the Worlds_19
36,"the left a busy little digging mechanism had come into view, emitting",The War of the Worlds_19
36,"jets of green vapour and working its way round the pit, excavating and",The War of the Worlds_19
36,embanking in a methodical and discriminating manner. This it was which,The War of the Worlds_19
36,"had caused the regular beating noise, and the rhythmic shocks that had",The War of the Worlds_19
36,kept our ruinous refuge quivering. It piped and whistled as it worked.,The War of the Worlds_19
36,"So far as I could see, the thing was without a directing Martian at",The War of the Worlds_19

36,THE DAYS OF IMPRISONMENT.,The War of the Worlds_20
36,,The War of the Worlds_20
36,,The War of the Worlds_20
36,The arrival of a second fighting-machine drove us from our peephole,The War of the Worlds_20
36,"into the scullery, for we feared that from his elevation the Martian",The War of the Worlds_20
36,might see down upon us behind our barrier. At a later date we began to,The War of the Worlds_20
36,"feel less in danger of their eyes, for to an eye in the dazzle of the",The War of the Worlds_20
36,"sunlight outside our refuge must have been blank blackness, but at",The War of the Worlds_20
36,first the slightest suggestion of approach drove us into the scullery,The War of the Worlds_20
36,"in heart-throbbing retreat. Yet terrible as was the danger we incurred,",The War of the Worlds_20
36,the attraction of peeping was for both of us irresistible. And I recall,The War of the Worlds_20
36,"now with a sort of wonder that, in spite of the infinite danger in",The War of the Worlds_20
36,"which we were between starvation and a still more terrible death, we",The War of the Worlds_20
36,could yet struggle bitterly for that horrible privilege of sight. We,The War of the Worlds_20
36,would race across the kitchen in a grotesque way between eagerness and,The War of the Worlds_20
36,"the dread of making a noise, and strike each other, and thrust and",The War of the Worlds_20
36,"kick, within a few inches of exposure.",The War of the Worlds_20
36,,The War of the Worlds_20
36,The fact is that we had absolutely incompatible dispositions and habits,The War of the Worlds_20
36,"of thought and action, and our danger and isolation only accentuated",The War of the Worlds_20
36,the incompatibility. At Halliford I had already come to hate the,The War of the Worlds_20
36,"curate’s trick of helpless exclamation, his stupid rigidity of mind.",The War of the Worlds_20
36,His endless muttering monologue vitiated every effort I made to think,The War of the Worlds_20
36,"out a line of action, and drove me at times, thus pent up and",The War of the Worlds_20
36,"intensified, almost to the verge of craziness. He was as lacking in",The War of the Worlds_20
36,"restraint as a silly woman. He would weep for hours together, and I",The War of the Worlds_20
36,verily believe that to the very end this spoiled child of life thought,The War of the Worlds_20
36,his weak tears in some way efficacious. And I would sit in the darkness,The War of the Worlds_20
36,unable to keep my mind off him by reason of his importunities. He ate,The War of the Worlds_20
36,"more than I did, and it was in vain I pointed out that our only chance",The War of the Worlds_20
36,of life was to stop in the house until the Martians had done with their,The War of the Worlds_20
36,"pit, that in that long patience a time might presently come when we",The War of the Worlds_20
36,should need food. He ate and drank impulsively in heavy meals at long,The War of the Worlds_20
36,intervals. He slept little.,The War of the Worlds_20
36,,The War of the Worlds_20
36,"As the days wore on, his utter carelessness of any consideration so",The War of the Worlds_20
36,"intensified our distress and danger that I had, much as I loathed doing",The War of the Worlds_20
36,"it, to resort to threats, and at last to blows. That brought him to",The War of the Worlds_20
36,"reason for a time. But he was one of those weak creatures, void of",The War of the Worlds_20
36,"pride, timorous, anæmic, hateful souls, full of shifty cunning, who",The War of the Worlds_20
36,"face neither God nor man, who face not even themselves.",The War of the Worlds_20
36,,The War of the Worlds_20
36,"It is disagreeable for me to recall and write these things, but I set",The War of the Worlds_20
36,them down that my story may lack nothing. Those who have escaped the,The War of the Worlds_20
36,"dark and terrible aspects of life will find my brutality, my flash of",The War of the Worlds_20
36,"rage in our final tragedy, easy enough to blame; for they know what is",The War of the Worlds_20
36,"wrong as well as any, but not what is possible to tortured men. But",The War of the Worlds_20
36,"those who have been under the shadow, who have gone down at last to",The War of the Worlds_20
36,"elemental things, will have a wider charity.",The War of the Worlds_20
36,,The War of the Worlds_20
36,"And while within we fought out our dark, dim contest of whispers,",The War of the Worlds_20
36,"snatched food and drink, and gripping hands and blows, without, in the",The War of the Worlds_20
36,"pitiless sunlight of that terrible June, was the strange wonder, the",The War of the Worlds_20
36,unfamiliar routine of the Martians in the pit. Let me return to those,The War of the Worlds_20
36,first new experiences of mine. After a long time I ventured back to the,The War of the Worlds_20
36,"peephole, to find that the new-comers had been reinforced by the",The War of the Worlds_20
36,occupants of no fewer than three of the fighting-machines. These last,The War of the Worlds_20
36,had brought with them certain fresh appliances that stood in an orderly,The War of the Worlds_20
36,manner about the cylinder. The second handling-machine was now,The War of the Worlds_20
36,"completed, and was busied in serving one of the novel contrivances the",The War of the Worlds_20
36,big machine had brought. This was a body resembling a milk can in its,The War of the Worlds_20
36,"general form, above which oscillated a pear-shaped receptacle, and from",The War of the Worlds_20
36,which a stream of white powder flowed into a circular basin below.,The War of the Worlds_20
36,,The War of the Worlds_20
36,The oscillatory motion was imparted to this by one tentacle of the,The War of the Worlds_20
36,handling-machine. With two spatulate hands the handling-machine was,The War of the Worlds_20
36,digging out and flinging masses of clay into the pear-shaped receptacle,The War of the Worlds_20
36,"above, while with another arm it periodically opened a door and removed",The War of the Worlds_20
36,rusty and blackened clinkers from the middle part of the machine.,The War of the Worlds_20
36,Another steely tentacle directed the powder from the basin along a,The War of the Worlds_20
36,ribbed channel towards some receiver that was hidden from me by the,The War of the Worlds_20
36,mound of bluish dust. From this unseen receiver a little thread of,The War of the Worlds_20
36,"green smoke rose vertically into the quiet air. As I looked, the",The War of the Worlds_20
36,"handling-machine, with a faint and musical clinking, extended,",The War of the Worlds_20
36,"telescopic fashion, a tentacle that had been a moment before a mere",The War of the Worlds_20
36,"blunt projection, until its end was hidden behind the mound of clay. In",The War of the Worlds_20
36,"another second it had lifted a bar of white aluminium into sight,",The War of the Worlds_20
36,"untarnished as yet, and shining dazzlingly, and deposited it in a",The War of the Worlds_20
36,growing stack of bars that stood at the side of the pit. Between sunset,The War of the Worlds_20
36,and starlight this dexterous machine must have made more than a hundred,The War of the Worlds_20
36,"such bars out of the crude clay, and the mound of bluish dust rose",The War of the Worlds_20
36,steadily until it topped the side of the pit.,The War of the Worlds_20
36,,The War of the Worlds_20
36,The contrast between the swift and complex movements of these,The War of the Worlds_20
36,contrivances and the inert panting clumsiness of their masters was,The War of the Worlds_20
36,"acute, and for days I had to tell myself repeatedly that these latter",The War of the Worlds_20
36,were indeed the living of the two things.,The War of the Worlds_20
36,,The War of the Worlds_20
36,The curate had possession of the slit when the first men were brought,The War of the Worlds_20
36,"to the pit. I was sitting below, huddled up, listening with all my",The War of the Worlds_20
36,"ears. He made a sudden movement backward, and I, fearful that we were",The War of the Worlds_20
36,"observed, crouched in a spasm of terror. He came sliding down the",The War of the Worlds_20
36,"rubbish and crept beside me in the darkness, inarticulate,",The War of the Worlds_20
36,"gesticulating, and for a moment I shared his panic. His gesture",The War of the Worlds_20
36,"suggested a resignation of the slit, and after a little while my",The War of the Worlds_20
36,"curiosity gave me courage, and I rose up, stepped across him, and",The War of the Worlds_20
36,clambered up to it. At first I could see no reason for his frantic,The War of the Worlds_20
36,"behaviour. The twilight had now come, the stars were little and faint,",The War of the Worlds_20
36,but the pit was illuminated by the flickering green fire that came from,The War of the Worlds_20
36,the aluminium-making. The whole picture was a flickering scheme of,The War of the Worlds_20
36,"green gleams and shifting rusty black shadows, strangely trying to the",The War of the Worlds_20
36,"eyes. Over and through it all went the bats, heeding it not at all. The",The War of the Worlds_20
36,"sprawling Martians were no longer to be seen, the mound of blue-green",The War of the Worlds_20
36,"powder had risen to cover them from sight, and a fighting-machine, with",The War of the Worlds_20
36,"its legs contracted, crumpled, and abbreviated, stood across the corner",The War of the Worlds_20
36,"of the pit. And then, amid the clangour of the machinery, came a",The War of the Worlds_20
36,"drifting suspicion of human voices, that I entertained at first only to",The War of the Worlds_20
36,dismiss.,The War of the Worlds_20
36,,The War of the Worlds_20
36,"I crouched, watching this fighting-machine closely, satisfying myself",The War of the Worlds_20
36,now for the first time that the hood did indeed contain a Martian. As,The War of the Worlds_20
36,the green flames lifted I could see the oily gleam of his integument,The War of the Worlds_20
36,"and the brightness of his eyes. And suddenly I heard a yell, and saw a",The War of the Worlds_20
36,long tentacle reaching over the shoulder of the machine to the little,The War of the Worlds_20
36,cage that hunched upon its back. Then something—something struggling,The War of the Worlds_20
36,"violently—was lifted high against the sky, a black, vague enigma",The War of the Worlds_20
36,"against the starlight; and as this black object came down again, I saw",The War of the Worlds_20
36,by the green brightness that it was a man. For an instant he was,The War of the Worlds_20
36,"clearly visible. He was a stout, ruddy, middle-aged man, well dressed;",The War of the Worlds_20
36,"three days before, he must have been walking the world, a man of",The War of the Worlds_20
36,considerable consequence. I could see his staring eyes and gleams of,The War of the Worlds_20
36,"light on his studs and watch chain. He vanished behind the mound, and",The War of the Worlds_20
36,for a moment there was silence. And then began a shrieking and a,The War of the Worlds_20
36,sustained and cheerful hooting from the Martians.,The War of the Worlds_20
36,,The War of the Worlds_20
36,"I slid down the rubbish, struggled to my feet, clapped my hands over my",The War of the Worlds_20
36,"ears, and bolted into the scullery. The curate, who had been crouching",The War of the Worlds_20
36,"silently with his arms over his head, looked up as I passed, cried out",The War of the Worlds_20
36,"quite loudly at my desertion of him, and came running after me.",The War of the Worlds_20
36,,The War of the Worlds_20
36,"That night, as we lurked in the scullery, balanced between our horror",The War of the Worlds_20
36,"and the terrible fascination this peeping had, although I felt an",The War of the Worlds_20
36,urgent need of action I tried in vain to conceive some plan of escape;,The War of the Worlds_20
36,"but afterwards, during the second day, I was able to consider our",The War of the Worlds_20
36,"position with great clearness. The curate, I found, was quite incapable",The War of the Worlds_20
36,of discussion; this new and culminating atrocity had robbed him of all,The War of the Worlds_20
36,vestiges of reason or forethought. Practically he had already sunk to,The War of the Worlds_20
36,"the level of an animal. But as the saying goes, I gripped myself with",The War of the Worlds_20
36,"both hands. It grew upon my mind, once I could face the facts, that",The War of the Worlds_20
36,"terrible as our position was, there was as yet no justification for",The War of the Worlds_20
36,absolute despair. Our chief chance lay in the possibility of the,The War of the Worlds_20
36,Martians making the pit nothing more than a temporary encampment. Or,The War of the Worlds_20
36,"even if they kept it permanently, they might not consider it necessary",The War of the Worlds_20
36,"to guard it, and a chance of escape might be afforded us. I also",The War of the Worlds_20
36,weighed very carefully the possibility of our digging a way out in a,The War of the Worlds_20
36,"direction away from the pit, but the chances of our emerging within",The War of the Worlds_20
36,sight of some sentinel fighting-machine seemed at first too great. And,The War of the Worlds_20
36,I should have had to do all the digging myself. The curate would,The War of the Worlds_20
36,certainly have failed me.,The War of the Worlds_20
36,,The War of the Worlds_20
36,"It was on the third day, if my memory serves me right, that I saw the",The War of the Worlds_20
36,lad killed. It was the only occasion on which I actually saw the,The War of the Worlds_20
36,Martians feed. After that experience I avoided the hole in the wall for,The War of the Worlds_20
36,"the better part of a day. I went into the scullery, removed the door,",The War of the Worlds_20
36,and spent some hours digging with my hatchet as silently as possible;,The War of the Worlds_20
36,but when I had made a hole about a couple of feet deep the loose earth,The War of the Worlds_20
36,"collapsed noisily, and I did not dare continue. I lost heart, and lay",The War of the Worlds_20
36,"down on the scullery floor for a long time, having no spirit even to",The War of the Worlds_20
36,move. And after that I abandoned altogether the idea of escaping by,The War of the Worlds_20
36,excavation.,The War of the Worlds_20
36,,The War of the Worlds_20
36,It says much for the impression the Martians had made upon me that at,The War of the Worlds_20
36,first I entertained little or no hope of our escape being brought about,The War of the Worlds_20
36,by their overthrow through any human effort. But on the fourth or fifth,The War of the Worlds_20
36,night I heard a sound like heavy guns.,The War of the Worlds_20
36,,The War of the Worlds_20
36,"It was very late in the night, and the moon was shining brightly. The",The War of the Worlds_20
36,"Martians had taken away the excavating-machine, and, save for a",The War of the Worlds_20
36,fighting-machine that stood in the remoter bank of the pit and a,The War of the Worlds_20
36,handling-machine that was buried out of my sight in a corner of the pit,The War of the Worlds_20
36,"immediately beneath my peephole, the place was deserted by them. Except",The War of the Worlds_20
36,for the pale glow from the handling-machine and the bars and patches of,The War of the Worlds_20
36,"white moonlight the pit was in darkness, and, except for the clinking",The War of the Worlds_20
36,"of the handling-machine, quite still. That night was a beautiful",The War of the Worlds_20
36,"serenity; save for one planet, the moon seemed to have the sky to",The War of the Worlds_20
36,"herself. I heard a dog howling, and that familiar sound it was that",The War of the Worlds_20
36,made me listen. Then I heard quite distinctly a booming exactly like,The War of the Worlds_20
36,"the sound of great guns. Six distinct reports I counted, and after a",The War of the Worlds_20
36,long interval six again. And that was all.,The War of the Worlds_20

36,THE DEATH OF THE CURATE.,The War of the Worlds_21
36,,The War of the Worlds_21
36,,The War of the Worlds_21
36,It was on the sixth day of our imprisonment that I peeped for the last,The War of the Worlds_21
36,"time, and presently found myself alone. Instead of keeping close to me",The War of the Worlds_21
36,"and trying to oust me from the slit, the curate had gone back into the",The War of the Worlds_21
36,scullery. I was struck by a sudden thought. I went back quickly and,The War of the Worlds_21
36,quietly into the scullery. In the darkness I heard the curate drinking.,The War of the Worlds_21
36,"I snatched in the darkness, and my fingers caught a bottle of burgundy.",The War of the Worlds_21
36,,The War of the Worlds_21
36,For a few minutes there was a tussle. The bottle struck the floor and,The War of the Worlds_21
36,"broke, and I desisted and rose. We stood panting and threatening each",The War of the Worlds_21
36,"other. In the end I planted myself between him and the food, and told",The War of the Worlds_21
36,him of my determination to begin a discipline. I divided the food in,The War of the Worlds_21
36,"the pantry, into rations to last us ten days. I would not let him eat",The War of the Worlds_21
36,any more that day. In the afternoon he made a feeble effort to get at,The War of the Worlds_21
36,"the food. I had been dozing, but in an instant I was awake. All day and",The War of the Worlds_21
36,"all night we sat face to face, I weary but resolute, and he weeping and",The War of the Worlds_21
36,"complaining of his immediate hunger. It was, I know, a night and a day,",The War of the Worlds_21
36,but to me it seemed—it seems now—an interminable length of time.,The War of the Worlds_21
36,,The War of the Worlds_21
36,And so our widened incompatibility ended at last in open conflict. For,The War of the Worlds_21
36,two vast days we struggled in undertones and wrestling contests. There,The War of the Worlds_21
36,"were times when I beat and kicked him madly, times when I cajoled and",The War of the Worlds_21
36,"persuaded him, and once I tried to bribe him with the last bottle of",The War of the Worlds_21
36,"burgundy, for there was a rain-water pump from which I could get water.",The War of the Worlds_21
36,But neither force nor kindness availed; he was indeed beyond reason. He,The War of the Worlds_21
36,would neither desist from his attacks on the food nor from his noisy,The War of the Worlds_21
36,babbling to himself. The rudimentary precautions to keep our,The War of the Worlds_21
36,imprisonment endurable he would not observe. Slowly I began to realise,The War of the Worlds_21
36,"the complete overthrow of his intelligence, to perceive that my sole",The War of the Worlds_21
36,companion in this close and sickly darkness was a man insane.,The War of the Worlds_21
36,,The War of the Worlds_21
36,From certain vague memories I am inclined to think my own mind wandered,The War of the Worlds_21
36,at times. I had strange and hideous dreams whenever I slept. It sounds,The War of the Worlds_21
36,"paradoxical, but I am inclined to think that the weakness and insanity",The War of the Worlds_21
36,"of the curate warned me, braced me, and kept me a sane man.",The War of the Worlds_21
36,,The War of the Worlds_21
36,"On the eighth day he began to talk aloud instead of whispering, and",The War of the Worlds_21
36,nothing I could do would moderate his speech.,The War of the Worlds_21
36,,The War of the Worlds_21
36,"“It is just, O God!” he would say, over and over again. “It is just. On",The War of the Worlds_21
36,"me and mine be the punishment laid. We have sinned, we have fallen",The War of the Worlds_21
36,"short. There was poverty, sorrow; the poor were trodden in the dust,",The War of the Worlds_21
36,"and I held my peace. I preached acceptable folly—my God, what",The War of the Worlds_21
36,"folly!—when I should have stood up, though I died for it, and called",The War of the Worlds_21
36,upon them to repent—repent! . . . Oppressors of the poor and needy . .,The War of the Worlds_21
36,. ! The wine press of God!”,The War of the Worlds_21
36,,The War of the Worlds_21
36,Then he would suddenly revert to the matter of the food I withheld from,The War of the Worlds_21
36,"him, praying, begging, weeping, at last threatening. He began to raise",The War of the Worlds_21
36,his voice—I prayed him not to. He perceived a hold on me—he threatened,The War of the Worlds_21
36,he would shout and bring the Martians upon us. For a time that scared,The War of the Worlds_21
36,me; but any concession would have shortened our chance of escape beyond,The War of the Worlds_21
36,"estimating. I defied him, although I felt no assurance that he might",The War of the Worlds_21
36,"not do this thing. But that day, at any rate, he did not. He talked",The War of the Worlds_21
36,"with his voice rising slowly, through the greater part of the eighth",The War of the Worlds_21
36,"and ninth days—threats, entreaties, mingled with a torrent of half-sane",The War of the Worlds_21
36,"and always frothy repentance for his vacant sham of God’s service, such",The War of the Worlds_21
36,"as made me pity him. Then he slept awhile, and began again with renewed",The War of the Worlds_21
36,"strength, so loudly that I must needs make him desist.",The War of the Worlds_21
36,,The War of the Worlds_21
36,“Be still!” I implored.,The War of the Worlds_21
36,,The War of the Worlds_21
36,"He rose to his knees, for he had been sitting in the darkness near the",The War of the Worlds_21
36,copper.,The War of the Worlds_21
36,,The War of the Worlds_21
36,"“I have been still too long,” he said, in a tone that must have reached",The War of the Worlds_21
36,"the pit, “and now I must bear my witness. Woe unto this unfaithful",The War of the Worlds_21
36,city! Woe! Woe! Woe! Woe! Woe! To the inhabitants of the earth by,The War of the Worlds_21
36,reason of the other voices of the trumpet——”,The War of the Worlds_21
36,,The War of the Worlds_21
36,"“Shut up!” I said, rising to my feet, and in a terror lest the Martians",The War of the Worlds_21
36,should hear us. “For God’s sake——”,The War of the Worlds_21
36,,The War of the Worlds_21
36,"“Nay,” shouted the curate, at the top of his voice, standing likewise",The War of the Worlds_21
36,and extending his arms. “Speak! The word of the Lord is upon me!”,The War of the Worlds_21
36,,The War of the Worlds_21
36,In three strides he was at the door leading into the kitchen.,The War of the Worlds_21
36,,The War of the Worlds_21
36,“I must bear my witness! I go! It has already been too long delayed.”,The War of the Worlds_21
36,,The War of the Worlds_21
36,I put out my hand and felt the meat chopper hanging to the wall. In a,The War of the Worlds_21
36,flash I was after him. I was fierce with fear. Before he was halfway,The War of the Worlds_21
36,across the kitchen I had overtaken him. With one last touch of humanity,The War of the Worlds_21
36,I turned the blade back and struck him with the butt. He went headlong,The War of the Worlds_21
36,forward and lay stretched on the ground. I stumbled over him and stood,The War of the Worlds_21
36,panting. He lay still.,The War of the Worlds_21
36,,The War of the Worlds_21
36,"Suddenly I heard a noise without, the run and smash of slipping",The War of the Worlds_21
36,"plaster, and the triangular aperture in the wall was darkened. I looked",The War of the Worlds_21
36,up and saw the lower surface of a handling-machine coming slowly across,The War of the Worlds_21
36,the hole. One of its gripping limbs curled amid the debris; another,The War of the Worlds_21
36,"limb appeared, feeling its way over the fallen beams. I stood",The War of the Worlds_21
36,"petrified, staring. Then I saw through a sort of glass plate near the",The War of the Worlds_21
36,"edge of the body the face, as we may call it, and the large dark eyes",The War of the Worlds_21
36,"of a Martian, peering, and then a long metallic snake of tentacle came",The War of the Worlds_21
36,feeling slowly through the hole.,The War of the Worlds_21
36,,The War of the Worlds_21
36,"I turned by an effort, stumbled over the curate, and stopped at the",The War of the Worlds_21
36,"scullery door. The tentacle was now some way, two yards or more, in the",The War of the Worlds_21
36,"room, and twisting and turning, with queer sudden movements, this way",The War of the Worlds_21
36,"and that. For a while I stood fascinated by that slow, fitful advance.",The War of the Worlds_21
36,"Then, with a faint, hoarse cry, I forced myself across the scullery. I",The War of the Worlds_21
36,trembled violently; I could scarcely stand upright. I opened the door,The War of the Worlds_21
36,"of the coal cellar, and stood there in the darkness staring at the",The War of the Worlds_21
36,"faintly lit doorway into the kitchen, and listening. Had the Martian",The War of the Worlds_21
36,seen me? What was it doing now?,The War of the Worlds_21
36,,The War of the Worlds_21
36,"Something was moving to and fro there, very quietly; every now and then",The War of the Worlds_21
36,"it tapped against the wall, or started on its movements with a faint",The War of the Worlds_21
36,"metallic ringing, like the movements of keys on a split-ring. Then a",The War of the Worlds_21
36,heavy body—I knew too well what—was dragged across the floor of the,The War of the Worlds_21
36,"kitchen towards the opening. Irresistibly attracted, I crept to the",The War of the Worlds_21
36,door and peeped into the kitchen. In the triangle of bright outer,The War of the Worlds_21
36,"sunlight I saw the Martian, in its Briareus of a handling-machine,",The War of the Worlds_21
36,scrutinizing the curate’s head. I thought at once that it would infer,The War of the Worlds_21
36,my presence from the mark of the blow I had given him.,The War of the Worlds_21
36,,The War of the Worlds_21
36,"I crept back to the coal cellar, shut the door, and began to cover",The War of the Worlds_21
36,"myself up as much as I could, and as noiselessly as possible in the",The War of the Worlds_21
36,"darkness, among the firewood and coal therein. Every now and then I",The War of the Worlds_21
36,"paused, rigid, to hear if the Martian had thrust its tentacles through",The War of the Worlds_21
36,the opening again.,The War of the Worlds_21
36,,The War of the Worlds_21
36,Then the faint metallic jingle returned. I traced it slowly feeling,The War of the Worlds_21
36,"over the kitchen. Presently I heard it nearer—in the scullery, as I",The War of the Worlds_21
36,judged. I thought that its length might be insufficient to reach me. I,The War of the Worlds_21
36,"prayed copiously. It passed, scraping faintly across the cellar door.",The War of the Worlds_21
36,An age of almost intolerable suspense intervened; then I heard it,The War of the Worlds_21
36,fumbling at the latch! It had found the door! The Martians understood,The War of the Worlds_21
36,doors!,The War of the Worlds_21
36,,The War of the Worlds_21
36,"It worried at the catch for a minute, perhaps, and then the door",The War of the Worlds_21
36,opened.,The War of the Worlds_21
36,,The War of the Worlds_21
36,In the darkness I could just see the thing—like an elephant’s trunk,The War of the Worlds_21
36,more than anything else—waving towards me and touching and examining,The War of the Worlds_21
36,"the wall, coals, wood and ceiling. It was like a black worm swaying its",The War of the Worlds_21
36,blind head to and fro.,The War of the Worlds_21
36,,The War of the Worlds_21
36,"Once, even, it touched the heel of my boot. I was on the verge of",The War of the Worlds_21
36,screaming; I bit my hand. For a time the tentacle was silent. I could,The War of the Worlds_21
36,"have fancied it had been withdrawn. Presently, with an abrupt click, it",The War of the Worlds_21
36,gripped something—I thought it had me!—and seemed to go out of the,The War of the Worlds_21
36,cellar again. For a minute I was not sure. Apparently it had taken a,The War of the Worlds_21
36,lump of coal to examine.,The War of the Worlds_21
36,,The War of the Worlds_21
36,"I seized the opportunity of slightly shifting my position, which had",The War of the Worlds_21
36,"become cramped, and then listened. I whispered passionate prayers for",The War of the Worlds_21
36,safety.,The War of the Worlds_21
36,,The War of the Worlds_21
36,"Then I heard the slow, deliberate sound creeping towards me again.",The War of the Worlds_21
36,"Slowly, slowly it drew near, scratching against the walls and tapping",The War of the Worlds_21
36,the furniture.,The War of the Worlds_21
36,,The War of the Worlds_21
36,"While I was still doubtful, it rapped smartly against the cellar door",The War of the Worlds_21
36,"and closed it. I heard it go into the pantry, and the biscuit-tins",The War of the Worlds_21
36,"rattled and a bottle smashed, and then came a heavy bump against the",The War of the Worlds_21
36,cellar door. Then silence that passed into an infinity of suspense.,The War of the Worlds_21
36,,The War of the Worlds_21
36,Had it gone?,The War of the Worlds_21
36,,The War of the Worlds_21
36,At last I decided that it had.,The War of the Worlds_21
36,,The War of the Worlds_21
36,It came into the scullery no more; but I lay all the tenth day in the,The War of the Worlds_21
36,"close darkness, buried among coals and firewood, not daring even to",The War of the Worlds_21
36,crawl out for the drink for which I craved. It was the eleventh day,The War of the Worlds_21
36,before I ventured so far from my security.,The War of the Worlds_21
36,,The War of the Worlds_21
36,,The War of the Worlds_21
36,,The War of the Worlds_21
36,,The War of the Worlds_21
36,V.,The War of the Worlds_22
36,THE STILLNESS.,The War of the Worlds_22
36,,The War of the Worlds_22
36,,The War of the Worlds_22
36,My first act before I went into the pantry was to fasten the door,The War of the Worlds_22
36,between the kitchen and the scullery. But the pantry was empty; every,The War of the Worlds_22
36,"scrap of food had gone. Apparently, the Martian had taken it all on the",The War of the Worlds_22
36,previous day. At that discovery I despaired for the first time. I took,The War of the Worlds_22
36,"no food, or no drink either, on the eleventh or the twelfth day.",The War of the Worlds_22
36,,The War of the Worlds_22
36,"At first my mouth and throat were parched, and my strength ebbed",The War of the Worlds_22
36,"sensibly. I sat about in the darkness of the scullery, in a state of",The War of the Worlds_22
36,despondent wretchedness. My mind ran on eating. I thought I had become,The War of the Worlds_22
36,"deaf, for the noises of movement I had been accustomed to hear from the",The War of the Worlds_22
36,pit had ceased absolutely. I did not feel strong enough to crawl,The War of the Worlds_22
36,"noiselessly to the peephole, or I would have gone there.",The War of the Worlds_22
36,,The War of the Worlds_22
36,"On the twelfth day my throat was so painful that, taking the chance of",The War of the Worlds_22
36,"alarming the Martians, I attacked the creaking rain-water pump that",The War of the Worlds_22
36,"stood by the sink, and got a couple of glassfuls of blackened and",The War of the Worlds_22
36,"tainted rain water. I was greatly refreshed by this, and emboldened by",The War of the Worlds_22
36,the fact that no enquiring tentacle followed the noise of my pumping.,The War of the Worlds_22
36,,The War of the Worlds_22
36,"During these days, in a rambling, inconclusive way, I thought much of",The War of the Worlds_22
36,the curate and of the manner of his death.,The War of the Worlds_22
36,,The War of the Worlds_22
36,"On the thirteenth day I drank some more water, and dozed and thought",The War of the Worlds_22
36,disjointedly of eating and of vague impossible plans of escape.,The War of the Worlds_22
36,"Whenever I dozed I dreamt of horrible phantasms, of the death of the",The War of the Worlds_22
36,"curate, or of sumptuous dinners; but, asleep or awake, I felt a keen",The War of the Worlds_22
36,pain that urged me to drink again and again. The light that came into,The War of the Worlds_22
36,"the scullery was no longer grey, but red. To my disordered imagination",The War of the Worlds_22
36,it seemed the colour of blood.,The War of the Worlds_22
36,,The War of the Worlds_22
36,"On the fourteenth day I went into the kitchen, and I was surprised to",The War of the Worlds_22
36,find that the fronds of the red weed had grown right across the hole in,The War of the Worlds_22
36,"the wall, turning the half-light of the place into a crimson-coloured",The War of the Worlds_22
36,obscurity.,The War of the Worlds_22
36,,The War of the Worlds_22
36,"It was early on the fifteenth day that I heard a curious, familiar",The War of the Worlds_22
36,"sequence of sounds in the kitchen, and, listening, identified it as the",The War of the Worlds_22
36,"snuffing and scratching of a dog. Going into the kitchen, I saw a dog’s",The War of the Worlds_22
36,nose peering in through a break among the ruddy fronds. This greatly,The War of the Worlds_22
36,surprised me. At the scent of me he barked shortly.,The War of the Worlds_22
36,,The War of the Worlds_22
36,I thought if I could induce him to come into the place quietly I should,The War of the Worlds_22
36,"be able, perhaps, to kill and eat him; and in any case, it would be",The War of the Worlds_22
36,"advisable to kill him, lest his actions attracted the attention of the",The War of the Worlds_22
36,Martians.,The War of the Worlds_22
36,,The War of the Worlds_22
36,"I crept forward, saying “Good dog!” very softly; but he suddenly",The War of the Worlds_22
36,withdrew his head and disappeared.,The War of the Worlds_22
36,,The War of the Worlds_22
36,I listened—I was not deaf—but certainly the pit was still. I heard a,The War of the Worlds_22
36,"sound like the flutter of a bird’s wings, and a hoarse croaking, but",The War of the Worlds_22
36,that was all.,The War of the Worlds_22
36,,The War of the Worlds_22
36,"For a long while I lay close to the peephole, but not daring to move",The War of the Worlds_22
36,aside the red plants that obscured it. Once or twice I heard a faint,The War of the Worlds_22
36,pitter-patter like the feet of the dog going hither and thither on the,The War of the Worlds_22
36,"sand far below me, and there were more birdlike sounds, but that was",The War of the Worlds_22
36,"all. At length, encouraged by the silence, I looked out.",The War of the Worlds_22
36,,The War of the Worlds_22
36,"Except in the corner, where a multitude of crows hopped and fought over",The War of the Worlds_22
36,"the skeletons of the dead the Martians had consumed, there was not a",The War of the Worlds_22
36,living thing in the pit.,The War of the Worlds_22
36,,The War of the Worlds_22
36,"I stared about me, scarcely believing my eyes. All the machinery had",The War of the Worlds_22
36,"gone. Save for the big mound of greyish-blue powder in one corner,",The War of the Worlds_22
36,"certain bars of aluminium in another, the black birds, and the",The War of the Worlds_22
36,"skeletons of the killed, the place was merely an empty circular pit in",The War of the Worlds_22
36,the sand.,The War of the Worlds_22
36,,The War of the Worlds_22
36,"Slowly I thrust myself out through the red weed, and stood upon the",The War of the Worlds_22
36,"mound of rubble. I could see in any direction save behind me, to the",The War of the Worlds_22
36,"north, and neither Martians nor sign of Martians were to be seen. The",The War of the Worlds_22
36,"pit dropped sheerly from my feet, but a little way along the rubbish",The War of the Worlds_22
36,afforded a practicable slope to the summit of the ruins. My chance of,The War of the Worlds_22
36,escape had come. I began to tremble.,The War of the Worlds_22
36,,The War of the Worlds_22
36,"I hesitated for some time, and then, in a gust of desperate resolution,",The War of the Worlds_22
36,"and with a heart that throbbed violently, I scrambled to the top of the",The War of the Worlds_22
36,mound in which I had been buried so long.,The War of the Worlds_22
36,,The War of the Worlds_22
36,"I looked about again. To the northward, too, no Martian was visible.",The War of the Worlds_22
36,,The War of the Worlds_22
36,When I had last seen this part of Sheen in the daylight it had been a,The War of the Worlds_22
36,"straggling street of comfortable white and red houses, interspersed",The War of the Worlds_22
36,"with abundant shady trees. Now I stood on a mound of smashed brickwork,",The War of the Worlds_22
36,"clay, and gravel, over which spread a multitude of red cactus-shaped",The War of the Worlds_22
36,"plants, knee-high, without a solitary terrestrial growth to dispute",The War of the Worlds_22
36,"their footing. The trees near me were dead and brown, but further a",The War of the Worlds_22
36,network of red thread scaled the still living stems.,The War of the Worlds_22
36,,The War of the Worlds_22
36,"The neighbouring houses had all been wrecked, but none had been burned;",The War of the Worlds_22
36,"their walls stood, sometimes to the second story, with smashed windows",The War of the Worlds_22
36,and shattered doors. The red weed grew tumultuously in their roofless,The War of the Worlds_22
36,"rooms. Below me was the great pit, with the crows struggling for its",The War of the Worlds_22
36,refuse. A number of other birds hopped about among the ruins. Far away,The War of the Worlds_22
36,"I saw a gaunt cat slink crouchingly along a wall, but traces of men",The War of the Worlds_22
36,there were none.,The War of the Worlds_22
36,,The War of the Worlds_22
36,"The day seemed, by contrast with my recent confinement, dazzlingly",The War of the Worlds_22
36,"bright, the sky a glowing blue. A gentle breeze kept the red weed that",The War of the Worlds_22
36,covered every scrap of unoccupied ground gently swaying. And oh! the,The War of the Worlds_22
36,sweetness of the air!,The War of the Worlds_22

36,THE WORK OF FIFTEEN DAYS.,The War of the Worlds_23
36,,The War of the Worlds_23
36,,The War of the Worlds_23
36,For some time I stood tottering on the mound regardless of my safety.,The War of the Worlds_23
36,Within that noisome den from which I had emerged I had thought with a,The War of the Worlds_23
36,narrow intensity only of our immediate security. I had not realised,The War of the Worlds_23
36,"what had been happening to the world, had not anticipated this",The War of the Worlds_23
36,startling vision of unfamiliar things. I had expected to see Sheen in,The War of the Worlds_23
36,"ruins—I found about me the landscape, weird and lurid, of another",The War of the Worlds_23
36,planet.,The War of the Worlds_23
36,,The War of the Worlds_23
36,"For that moment I touched an emotion beyond the common range of men,",The War of the Worlds_23
36,yet one that the poor brutes we dominate know only too well. I felt as,The War of the Worlds_23
36,a rabbit might feel returning to his burrow and suddenly confronted by,The War of the Worlds_23
36,the work of a dozen busy navvies digging the foundations of a house. I,The War of the Worlds_23
36,felt the first inkling of a thing that presently grew quite clear in my,The War of the Worlds_23
36,"mind, that oppressed me for many days, a sense of dethronement, a",The War of the Worlds_23
36,"persuasion that I was no longer a master, but an animal among the",The War of the Worlds_23
36,"animals, under the Martian heel. With us it would be as with them, to",The War of the Worlds_23
36,"lurk and watch, to run and hide; the fear and empire of man had passed",The War of the Worlds_23
36,away.,The War of the Worlds_23
36,,The War of the Worlds_23
36,"But so soon as this strangeness had been realised it passed, and my",The War of the Worlds_23
36,dominant motive became the hunger of my long and dismal fast. In the,The War of the Worlds_23
36,"direction away from the pit I saw, beyond a red-covered wall, a patch",The War of the Worlds_23
36,"of garden ground unburied. This gave me a hint, and I went knee-deep,",The War of the Worlds_23
36,"and sometimes neck-deep, in the red weed. The density of the weed gave",The War of the Worlds_23
36,"me a reassuring sense of hiding. The wall was some six feet high, and",The War of the Worlds_23
36,when I attempted to clamber it I found I could not lift my feet to the,The War of the Worlds_23
36,"crest. So I went along by the side of it, and came to a corner and a",The War of the Worlds_23
36,"rockwork that enabled me to get to the top, and tumble into the garden",The War of the Worlds_23
36,"I coveted. Here I found some young onions, a couple of gladiolus bulbs,",The War of the Worlds_23
36,"and a quantity of immature carrots, all of which I secured, and,",The War of the Worlds_23
36,"scrambling over a ruined wall, went on my way through scarlet and",The War of the Worlds_23
36,crimson trees towards Kew—it was like walking through an avenue of,The War of the Worlds_23
36,"gigantic blood drops—possessed with two ideas: to get more food, and to",The War of the Worlds_23
36,"limp, as soon and as far as my strength permitted, out of this accursed",The War of the Worlds_23
36,unearthly region of the pit.,The War of the Worlds_23
36,,The War of the Worlds_23
36,"Some way farther, in a grassy place, was a group of mushrooms which",The War of the Worlds_23
36,"also I devoured, and then I came upon a brown sheet of flowing shallow",The War of the Worlds_23
36,"water, where meadows used to be. These fragments of nourishment served",The War of the Worlds_23
36,only to whet my hunger. At first I was surprised at this flood in a,The War of the Worlds_23
36,"hot, dry summer, but afterwards I discovered that it was caused by the",The War of the Worlds_23
36,tropical exuberance of the red weed. Directly this extraordinary growth,The War of the Worlds_23
36,encountered water it straightway became gigantic and of unparalleled,The War of the Worlds_23
36,fecundity. Its seeds were simply poured down into the water of the Wey,The War of the Worlds_23
36,"and Thames, and its swiftly growing and Titanic water fronds speedily",The War of the Worlds_23
36,choked both those rivers.,The War of the Worlds_23
36,,The War of the Worlds_23
36,"At Putney, as I afterwards saw, the bridge was almost lost in a tangle",The War of the Worlds_23
36,"of this weed, and at Richmond, too, the Thames water poured in a broad",The War of the Worlds_23
36,and shallow stream across the meadows of Hampton and Twickenham. As the,The War of the Worlds_23
36,"water spread the weed followed them, until the ruined villas of the",The War of the Worlds_23
36,"Thames valley were for a time lost in this red swamp, whose margin I",The War of the Worlds_23
36,"explored, and much of the desolation the Martians had caused was",The War of the Worlds_23
36,concealed.,The War of the Worlds_23
36,,The War of the Worlds_23
36,In the end the red weed succumbed almost as quickly as it had spread. A,The War of the Worlds_23
36,"cankering disease, due, it is believed, to the action of certain",The War of the Worlds_23
36,"bacteria, presently seized upon it. Now by the action of natural",The War of the Worlds_23
36,"selection, all terrestrial plants have acquired a resisting power",The War of the Worlds_23
36,against bacterial diseases—they never succumb without a severe,The War of the Worlds_23
36,"struggle, but the red weed rotted like a thing already dead. The fronds",The War of the Worlds_23
36,"became bleached, and then shrivelled and brittle. They broke off at the",The War of the Worlds_23
36,"least touch, and the waters that had stimulated their early growth",The War of the Worlds_23
36,carried their last vestiges out to sea.,The War of the Worlds_23
36,,The War of the Worlds_23
36,"My first act on coming to this water was, of course, to slake my",The War of the Worlds_23
36,"thirst. I drank a great deal of it and, moved by an impulse, gnawed",The War of the Worlds_23
36,"some fronds of red weed; but they were watery, and had a sickly,",The War of the Worlds_23
36,metallic taste. I found the water was sufficiently shallow for me to,The War of the Worlds_23
36,"wade securely, although the red weed impeded my feet a little; but the",The War of the Worlds_23
36,"flood evidently got deeper towards the river, and I turned back to",The War of the Worlds_23
36,Mortlake. I managed to make out the road by means of occasional ruins,The War of the Worlds_23
36,"of its villas and fences and lamps, and so presently I got out of this",The War of the Worlds_23
36,spate and made my way to the hill going up towards Roehampton and came,The War of the Worlds_23
36,out on Putney Common.,The War of the Worlds_23
36,,The War of the Worlds_23
36,Here the scenery changed from the strange and unfamiliar to the,The War of the Worlds_23
36,wreckage of the familiar: patches of ground exhibited the devastation,The War of the Worlds_23
36,"of a cyclone, and in a few score yards I would come upon perfectly",The War of the Worlds_23
36,"undisturbed spaces, houses with their blinds trimly drawn and doors",The War of the Worlds_23
36,"closed, as if they had been left for a day by the owners, or as if",The War of the Worlds_23
36,their inhabitants slept within. The red weed was less abundant; the,The War of the Worlds_23
36,tall trees along the lane were free from the red creeper. I hunted for,The War of the Worlds_23
36,"food among the trees, finding nothing, and I also raided a couple of",The War of the Worlds_23
36,"silent houses, but they had already been broken into and ransacked. I",The War of the Worlds_23
36,"rested for the remainder of the daylight in a shrubbery, being, in my",The War of the Worlds_23
36,"enfeebled condition, too fatigued to push on.",The War of the Worlds_23
36,,The War of the Worlds_23
36,"All this time I saw no human beings, and no signs of the Martians. I",The War of the Worlds_23
36,"encountered a couple of hungry-looking dogs, but both hurried",The War of the Worlds_23
36,circuitously away from the advances I made them. Near Roehampton I had,The War of the Worlds_23
36,"seen two human skeletons—not bodies, but skeletons, picked clean—and in",The War of the Worlds_23
36,the wood by me I found the crushed and scattered bones of several cats,The War of the Worlds_23
36,and rabbits and the skull of a sheep. But though I gnawed parts of,The War of the Worlds_23
36,"these in my mouth, there was nothing to be got from them.",The War of the Worlds_23
36,,The War of the Worlds_23
36,"After sunset I struggled on along the road towards Putney, where I",The War of the Worlds_23
36,think the Heat-Ray must have been used for some reason. And in the,The War of the Worlds_23
36,"garden beyond Roehampton I got a quantity of immature potatoes,",The War of the Worlds_23
36,sufficient to stay my hunger. From this garden one looked down upon,The War of the Worlds_23
36,Putney and the river. The aspect of the place in the dusk was,The War of the Worlds_23
36,"singularly desolate: blackened trees, blackened, desolate ruins, and",The War of the Worlds_23
36,"down the hill the sheets of the flooded river, red-tinged with the",The War of the Worlds_23
36,weed. And over all—silence. It filled me with indescribable terror to,The War of the Worlds_23
36,think how swiftly that desolating change had come.,The War of the Worlds_23
36,,The War of the Worlds_23
36,"For a time I believed that mankind had been swept out of existence, and",The War of the Worlds_23
36,"that I stood there alone, the last man left alive. Hard by the top of",The War of the Worlds_23
36,"Putney Hill I came upon another skeleton, with the arms dislocated and",The War of the Worlds_23
36,removed several yards from the rest of the body. As I proceeded I,The War of the Worlds_23
36,"became more and more convinced that the extermination of mankind was,",The War of the Worlds_23
36,"save for such stragglers as myself, already accomplished in this part",The War of the Worlds_23
36,"of the world. The Martians, I thought, had gone on and left the country",The War of the Worlds_23
36,"desolated, seeking food elsewhere. Perhaps even now they were",The War of the Worlds_23
36,"destroying Berlin or Paris, or it might be they had gone northward.",The War of the Worlds_23

36,VII.,The War of the Worlds_24
36,THE MAN ON PUTNEY HILL.,The War of the Worlds_24
36,,The War of the Worlds_24
36,,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"I spent that night in the inn that stands at the top of Putney Hill,",The War of the Worlds_24
36,sleeping in a made bed for the first time since my flight to,The War of the Worlds_24
36,Leatherhead. I will not tell the needless trouble I had breaking into,The War of the Worlds_24
36,that house—afterwards I found the front door was on the latch—nor how I,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"ransacked every room for food, until just on the verge of despair, in",The War of the Worlds_24
36,"what seemed to me to be a servant’s bedroom, I found a rat-gnawed crust",The War of the Worlds_24
36,and two tins of pineapple. The place had been already searched and,The War of the Worlds_24
36,emptied. In the bar I afterwards found some biscuits and sandwiches,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"that had been overlooked. The latter I could not eat, they were too",The War of the Worlds_24
36,"rotten, but the former not only stayed my hunger, but filled my",The War of the Worlds_24
36,"pockets. I lit no lamps, fearing some Martian might come beating that",The War of the Worlds_24
36,part of London for food in the night. Before I went to bed I had an,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"interval of restlessness, and prowled from window to window, peering",The War of the Worlds_24
36,out for some sign of these monsters. I slept little. As I lay in bed I,The War of the Worlds_24
36,found myself thinking consecutively—a thing I do not remember to have,The War of the Worlds_24
36,done since my last argument with the curate. During all the intervening,The War of the Worlds_24
36,time my mental condition had been a hurrying succession of vague,The War of the Worlds_24
36,emotional states or a sort of stupid receptivity. But in the night my,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"brain, reinforced, I suppose, by the food I had eaten, grew clear",The War of the Worlds_24
36,"again, and I thought.",The War of the Worlds_24
36,,The War of the Worlds_24
36,Three things struggled for possession of my mind: the killing of the,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"curate, the whereabouts of the Martians, and the possible fate of my",The War of the Worlds_24
36,wife. The former gave me no sensation of horror or remorse to recall; I,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"saw it simply as a thing done, a memory infinitely disagreeable but",The War of the Worlds_24
36,quite without the quality of remorse. I saw myself then as I see myself,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"now, driven step by step towards that hasty blow, the creature of a",The War of the Worlds_24
36,sequence of accidents leading inevitably to that. I felt no,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"condemnation; yet the memory, static, unprogressive, haunted me. In the",The War of the Worlds_24
36,"silence of the night, with that sense of the nearness of God that",The War of the Worlds_24
36,"sometimes comes into the stillness and the darkness, I stood my trial,",The War of the Worlds_24
36,"my only trial, for that moment of wrath and fear. I retraced every step",The War of the Worlds_24
36,of our conversation from the moment when I had found him crouching,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"beside me, heedless of my thirst, and pointing to the fire and smoke",The War of the Worlds_24
36,that streamed up from the ruins of Weybridge. We had been incapable of,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"co-operation—grim chance had taken no heed of that. Had I foreseen, I",The War of the Worlds_24
36,should have left him at Halliford. But I did not foresee; and crime is,The War of the Worlds_24
36,to foresee and do. And I set this down as I have set all this story,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"down, as it was. There were no witnesses—all these things I might have",The War of the Worlds_24
36,"concealed. But I set it down, and the reader must form his judgment as",The War of the Worlds_24
36,he will.,The War of the Worlds_24
36,,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"And when, by an effort, I had set aside that picture of a prostrate",The War of the Worlds_24
36,"body, I faced the problem of the Martians and the fate of my wife. For",The War of the Worlds_24
36,"the former I had no data; I could imagine a hundred things, and so,",The War of the Worlds_24
36,"unhappily, I could for the latter. And suddenly that night became",The War of the Worlds_24
36,"terrible. I found myself sitting up in bed, staring at the dark. I",The War of the Worlds_24
36,found myself praying that the Heat-Ray might have suddenly and,The War of the Worlds_24
36,painlessly struck her out of being. Since the night of my return from,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"Leatherhead I had not prayed. I had uttered prayers, fetish prayers,",The War of the Worlds_24
36,had prayed as heathens mutter charms when I was in extremity; but now I,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"prayed indeed, pleading steadfastly and sanely, face to face with the",The War of the Worlds_24
36,"darkness of God. Strange night! Strangest in this, that so soon as dawn",The War of the Worlds_24
36,"had come, I, who had talked with God, crept out of the house like a rat",The War of the Worlds_24
36,"leaving its hiding place—a creature scarcely larger, an inferior",The War of the Worlds_24
36,"animal, a thing that for any passing whim of our masters might be",The War of the Worlds_24
36,"hunted and killed. Perhaps they also prayed confidently to God. Surely,",The War of the Worlds_24
36,"if we have learned nothing else, this war has taught us pity—pity for",The War of the Worlds_24
36,those witless souls that suffer our dominion.,The War of the Worlds_24
36,,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"The morning was bright and fine, and the eastern sky glowed pink, and",The War of the Worlds_24
36,was fretted with little golden clouds. In the road that runs from the,The War of the Worlds_24
36,top of Putney Hill to Wimbledon was a number of poor vestiges of the,The War of the Worlds_24
36,panic torrent that must have poured Londonward on the Sunday night,The War of the Worlds_24
36,after the fighting began. There was a little two-wheeled cart inscribed,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"with the name of Thomas Lobb, Greengrocer, New Malden, with a smashed",The War of the Worlds_24
36,wheel and an abandoned tin trunk; there was a straw hat trampled into,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"the now hardened mud, and at the top of West Hill a lot of",The War of the Worlds_24
36,blood-stained glass about the overturned water trough. My movements,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"were languid, my plans of the vaguest. I had an idea of going to",The War of the Worlds_24
36,"Leatherhead, though I knew that there I had the poorest chance of",The War of the Worlds_24
36,"finding my wife. Certainly, unless death had overtaken them suddenly,",The War of the Worlds_24
36,my cousins and she would have fled thence; but it seemed to me I might,The War of the Worlds_24
36,find or learn there whither the Surrey people had fled. I knew I wanted,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"to find my wife, that my heart ached for her and the world of men, but",The War of the Worlds_24
36,I had no clear idea how the finding might be done. I was also sharply,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"aware now of my intense loneliness. From the corner I went, under cover",The War of the Worlds_24
36,"of a thicket of trees and bushes, to the edge of Wimbledon Common,",The War of the Worlds_24
36,stretching wide and far.,The War of the Worlds_24
36,,The War of the Worlds_24
36,That dark expanse was lit in patches by yellow gorse and broom; there,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"was no red weed to be seen, and as I prowled, hesitating, on the verge",The War of the Worlds_24
36,"of the open, the sun rose, flooding it all with light and vitality. I",The War of the Worlds_24
36,came upon a busy swarm of little frogs in a swampy place among the,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"trees. I stopped to look at them, drawing a lesson from their stout",The War of the Worlds_24
36,"resolve to live. And presently, turning suddenly, with an odd feeling",The War of the Worlds_24
36,"of being watched, I beheld something crouching amid a clump of bushes.",The War of the Worlds_24
36,"I stood regarding this. I made a step towards it, and it rose up and",The War of the Worlds_24
36,became a man armed with a cutlass. I approached him slowly. He stood,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"silent and motionless, regarding me.",The War of the Worlds_24
36,,The War of the Worlds_24
36,As I drew nearer I perceived he was dressed in clothes as dusty and,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"filthy as my own; he looked, indeed, as though he had been dragged",The War of the Worlds_24
36,"through a culvert. Nearer, I distinguished the green slime of ditches",The War of the Worlds_24
36,"mixing with the pale drab of dried clay and shiny, coaly patches. His",The War of the Worlds_24
36,"black hair fell over his eyes, and his face was dark and dirty and",The War of the Worlds_24
36,"sunken, so that at first I did not recognise him. There was a red cut",The War of the Worlds_24
36,across the lower part of his face.,The War of the Worlds_24
36,,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"“Stop!” he cried, when I was within ten yards of him, and I stopped.",The War of the Worlds_24
36,His voice was hoarse. “Where do you come from?” he said.,The War of the Worlds_24
36,,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"I thought, surveying him.",The War of the Worlds_24
36,,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"“I come from Mortlake,” I said. “I was buried near the pit the Martians",The War of the Worlds_24
36,made about their cylinder. I have worked my way out and escaped.”,The War of the Worlds_24
36,,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"“There is no food about here,” he said. “This is my country. All this",The War of the Worlds_24
36,"hill down to the river, and back to Clapham, and up to the edge of the",The War of the Worlds_24
36,common. There is only food for one. Which way are you going?”,The War of the Worlds_24
36,,The War of the Worlds_24
36,I answered slowly.,The War of the Worlds_24
36,,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"“I don’t know,” I said. “I have been buried in the ruins of a house",The War of the Worlds_24
36,thirteen or fourteen days. I don’t know what has happened.”,The War of the Worlds_24
36,,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"He looked at me doubtfully, then started, and looked with a changed",The War of the Worlds_24
36,expression.,The War of the Worlds_24
36,,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"“I’ve no wish to stop about here,” said I. “I think I shall go to",The War of the Worlds_24
36,"Leatherhead, for my wife was there.”",The War of the Worlds_24
36,,The War of the Worlds_24
36,He shot out a pointing finger.,The War of the Worlds_24
36,,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"“It is you,” said he; “the man from Woking. And you weren’t killed at",The War of the Worlds_24
36,Weybridge?”,The War of the Worlds_24
36,,The War of the Worlds_24
36,I recognised him at the same moment.,The War of the Worlds_24
36,,The War of the Worlds_24
36,“You are the artilleryman who came into my garden.”,The War of the Worlds_24
36,,The War of the Worlds_24
36,“Good luck!” he said. “We are lucky ones! Fancy _you_!” He put out a,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"hand, and I took it. “I crawled up a drain,” he said. “But they didn’t",The War of the Worlds_24
36,kill everyone. And after they went away I got off towards Walton across,The War of the Worlds_24
36,the fields. But—— It’s not sixteen days altogether—and your hair is,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"grey.” He looked over his shoulder suddenly. “Only a rook,” he said.",The War of the Worlds_24
36,“One gets to know that birds have shadows these days. This is a bit,The War of the Worlds_24
36,open. Let us crawl under those bushes and talk.”,The War of the Worlds_24
36,,The War of the Worlds_24
36,“Have you seen any Martians?” I said. “Since I crawled out——”,The War of the Worlds_24
36,,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"“They’ve gone away across London,” he said. “I guess they’ve got a",The War of the Worlds_24
36,"bigger camp there. Of a night, all over there, Hampstead way, the sky",The War of the Worlds_24
36,"is alive with their lights. It’s like a great city, and in the glare",The War of the Worlds_24
36,you can just see them moving. By daylight you can’t. But nearer—I,The War of the Worlds_24
36,haven’t seen them—” (he counted on his fingers) “five days. Then I saw,The War of the Worlds_24
36,a couple across Hammersmith way carrying something big. And the night,The War of the Worlds_24
36,before last”—he stopped and spoke impressively—“it was just a matter of,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"lights, but it was something up in the air. I believe they’ve built a",The War of the Worlds_24
36,"flying-machine, and are learning to fly.”",The War of the Worlds_24
36,,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"I stopped, on hands and knees, for we had come to the bushes.",The War of the Worlds_24
36,,The War of the Worlds_24
36,“Fly!”,The War of the Worlds_24
36,,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"“Yes,” he said, “fly.”",The War of the Worlds_24
36,,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"I went on into a little bower, and sat down.",The War of the Worlds_24
36,,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"“It is all over with humanity,” I said. “If they can do that they will",The War of the Worlds_24
36,simply go round the world.”,The War of the Worlds_24
36,,The War of the Worlds_24
36,He nodded.,The War of the Worlds_24
36,,The War of the Worlds_24
36,“They will. But—— It will relieve things over here a bit. And,The War of the Worlds_24
36,besides——” He looked at me. “Aren’t you satisfied it _is_ up with,The War of the Worlds_24
36,humanity? I am. We’re down; we’re beat.”,The War of the Worlds_24
36,,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"I stared. Strange as it may seem, I had not arrived at this fact—a fact",The War of the Worlds_24
36,perfectly obvious so soon as he spoke. I had still held a vague hope;,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"rather, I had kept a lifelong habit of mind. He repeated his words,",The War of the Worlds_24
36,“We’re beat.” They carried absolute conviction.,The War of the Worlds_24
36,,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"“It’s all over,” he said. “They’ve lost _one_—just _one_. And they’ve",The War of the Worlds_24
36,made their footing good and crippled the greatest power in the world.,The War of the Worlds_24
36,They’ve walked over us. The death of that one at Weybridge was an,The War of the Worlds_24
36,accident. And these are only pioneers. They kept on coming. These green,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"stars—I’ve seen none these five or six days, but I’ve no doubt they’re",The War of the Worlds_24
36,falling somewhere every night. Nothing’s to be done. We’re under! We’re,The War of the Worlds_24
36,beat!”,The War of the Worlds_24
36,,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"I made him no answer. I sat staring before me, trying in vain to devise",The War of the Worlds_24
36,some countervailing thought.,The War of the Worlds_24
36,,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"“This isn’t a war,” said the artilleryman. “It never was a war, any",The War of the Worlds_24
36,more than there’s war between man and ants.”,The War of the Worlds_24
36,,The War of the Worlds_24
36,Suddenly I recalled the night in the observatory.,The War of the Worlds_24
36,,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"“After the tenth shot they fired no more—at least, until the first",The War of the Worlds_24
36,cylinder came.”,The War of the Worlds_24
36,,The War of the Worlds_24
36,“How do you know?” said the artilleryman. I explained. He thought.,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"“Something wrong with the gun,” he said. “But what if there is? They’ll",The War of the Worlds_24
36,"get it right again. And even if there’s a delay, how can it alter the",The War of the Worlds_24
36,"end? It’s just men and ants. There’s the ants builds their cities, live",The War of the Worlds_24
36,"their lives, have wars, revolutions, until the men want them out of the",The War of the Worlds_24
36,"way, and then they go out of the way. That’s what we are now—just ants.",The War of the Worlds_24
36,Only——”,The War of the Worlds_24
36,,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"“Yes,” I said.",The War of the Worlds_24
36,,The War of the Worlds_24
36,“We’re eatable ants.”,The War of the Worlds_24
36,,The War of the Worlds_24
36,We sat looking at each other.,The War of the Worlds_24
36,,The War of the Worlds_24
36,“And what will they do with us?” I said.,The War of the Worlds_24
36,,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"“That’s what I’ve been thinking,” he said; “that’s what I’ve been",The War of the Worlds_24
36,thinking. After Weybridge I went south—thinking. I saw what was up.,The War of the Worlds_24
36,Most of the people were hard at it squealing and exciting themselves.,The War of the Worlds_24
36,But I’m not so fond of squealing. I’ve been in sight of death once or,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"twice; I’m not an ornamental soldier, and at the best and worst,",The War of the Worlds_24
36,death—it’s just death. And it’s the man that keeps on thinking comes,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"through. I saw everyone tracking away south. Says I, ‘Food won’t last",The War of the Worlds_24
36,"this way,’ and I turned right back. I went for the Martians like a",The War of the Worlds_24
36,sparrow goes for man. All round”—he waved a hand to the,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"horizon—“they’re starving in heaps, bolting, treading on each other. .",The War of the Worlds_24
36,. .”,The War of the Worlds_24
36,,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"He saw my face, and halted awkwardly.",The War of the Worlds_24
36,,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"“No doubt lots who had money have gone away to France,” he said. He",The War of the Worlds_24
36,"seemed to hesitate whether to apologise, met my eyes, and went on:",The War of the Worlds_24
36,"“There’s food all about here. Canned things in shops; wines, spirits,",The War of the Worlds_24
36,"mineral waters; and the water mains and drains are empty. Well, I was",The War of the Worlds_24
36,"telling you what I was thinking. ‘Here’s intelligent things,’ I said,",The War of the Worlds_24
36,"‘and it seems they want us for food. First, they’ll smash us up—ships,",The War of the Worlds_24
36,"machines, guns, cities, all the order and organisation. All that will",The War of the Worlds_24
36,go. If we were the size of ants we might pull through. But we’re not.,The War of the Worlds_24
36,It’s all too bulky to stop. That’s the first certainty.’ Eh?”,The War of the Worlds_24
36,,The War of the Worlds_24
36,I assented.,The War of the Worlds_24
36,,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"“It is; I’ve thought it out. Very well, then—next; at present we’re",The War of the Worlds_24
36,caught as we’re wanted. A Martian has only to go a few miles to get a,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"crowd on the run. And I saw one, one day, out by Wandsworth, picking",The War of the Worlds_24
36,houses to pieces and routing among the wreckage. But they won’t keep on,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"doing that. So soon as they’ve settled all our guns and ships, and",The War of the Worlds_24
36,"smashed our railways, and done all the things they are doing over",The War of the Worlds_24
36,"there, they will begin catching us systematic, picking the best and",The War of the Worlds_24
36,storing us in cages and things. That’s what they will start doing in a,The War of the Worlds_24
36,bit. Lord! They haven’t begun on us yet. Don’t you see that?”,The War of the Worlds_24
36,,The War of the Worlds_24
36,“Not begun!” I exclaimed.,The War of the Worlds_24
36,,The War of the Worlds_24
36,“Not begun. All that’s happened so far is through our not having the,The War of the Worlds_24
36,sense to keep quiet—worrying them with guns and such foolery. And,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"losing our heads, and rushing off in crowds to where there wasn’t any",The War of the Worlds_24
36,more safety than where we were. They don’t want to bother us yet.,The War of the Worlds_24
36,They’re making their things—making all the things they couldn’t bring,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"with them, getting things ready for the rest of their people. Very",The War of the Worlds_24
36,"likely that’s why the cylinders have stopped for a bit, for fear of",The War of the Worlds_24
36,"hitting those who are here. And instead of our rushing about blind, on",The War of the Worlds_24
36,"the howl, or getting dynamite on the chance of busting them up, we’ve",The War of the Worlds_24
36,got to fix ourselves up according to the new state of affairs. That’s,The War of the Worlds_24
36,how I figure it out. It isn’t quite according to what a man wants for,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"his species, but it’s about what the facts point to. And that’s the",The War of the Worlds_24
36,"principle I acted upon. Cities, nations, civilisation, progress—it’s",The War of the Worlds_24
36,all over. That game’s up. We’re beat.”,The War of the Worlds_24
36,,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"“But if that is so, what is there to live for?”",The War of the Worlds_24
36,,The War of the Worlds_24
36,The artilleryman looked at me for a moment.,The War of the Worlds_24
36,,The War of the Worlds_24
36,“There won’t be any more blessed concerts for a million years or so;,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"there won’t be any Royal Academy of Arts, and no nice little feeds at",The War of the Worlds_24
36,"restaurants. If it’s amusement you’re after, I reckon the game is up.",The War of the Worlds_24
36,If you’ve got any drawing-room manners or a dislike to eating peas with,The War of the Worlds_24

36,,The War of the Worlds_24
36,“You mean——”,The War of the Worlds_24
36,,The War of the Worlds_24
36,“I mean that men like me are going on living—for the sake of the breed.,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"I tell you, I’m grim set on living. And if I’m not mistaken, you’ll",The War of the Worlds_24
36,"show what insides _you’ve_ got, too, before long. We aren’t going to be",The War of the Worlds_24
36,"exterminated. And I don’t mean to be caught either, and tamed and",The War of the Worlds_24
36,fattened and bred like a thundering ox. Ugh! Fancy those brown,The War of the Worlds_24
36,creepers!”,The War of the Worlds_24
36,,The War of the Worlds_24
36,“You don’t mean to say——”,The War of the Worlds_24
36,,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"“I do. I’m going on, under their feet. I’ve got it planned; I’ve",The War of the Worlds_24
36,thought it out. We men are beat. We don’t know enough. We’ve got to,The War of the Worlds_24
36,learn before we’ve got a chance. And we’ve got to live and keep,The War of the Worlds_24
36,independent while we learn. See! That’s what has to be done.”,The War of the Worlds_24
36,,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"I stared, astonished, and stirred profoundly by the man’s resolution.",The War of the Worlds_24
36,,The War of the Worlds_24
36,“Great God!” cried I. “But you are a man indeed!” And suddenly I,The War of the Worlds_24
36,gripped his hand.,The War of the Worlds_24
36,,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"“Eh!” he said, with his eyes shining. “I’ve thought it out, eh?”",The War of the Worlds_24
36,,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"“Go on,” I said.",The War of the Worlds_24
36,,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"“Well, those who mean to escape their catching must get ready. I’m",The War of the Worlds_24
36,"getting ready. Mind you, it isn’t all of us that are made for wild",The War of the Worlds_24
36,beasts; and that’s what it’s got to be. That’s why I watched you. I had,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"my doubts. You’re slender. I didn’t know that it was you, you see, or",The War of the Worlds_24
36,just how you’d been buried. All these—the sort of people that lived in,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"these houses, and all those damn little clerks that used to live down",The War of the Worlds_24
36,_that_ way—they’d be no good. They haven’t any spirit in them—no proud,The War of the Worlds_24
36,dreams and no proud lusts; and a man who hasn’t one or the other—Lord!,The War of the Worlds_24
36,What is he but funk and precautions? They just used to skedaddle off to,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"work—I’ve seen hundreds of ’em, bit of breakfast in hand, running wild",The War of the Worlds_24
36,"and shining to catch their little season-ticket train, for fear they’d",The War of the Worlds_24
36,get dismissed if they didn’t; working at businesses they were afraid to,The War of the Worlds_24
36,take the trouble to understand; skedaddling back for fear they wouldn’t,The War of the Worlds_24
36,be in time for dinner; keeping indoors after dinner for fear of the,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"back streets, and sleeping with the wives they married, not because",The War of the Worlds_24
36,"they wanted them, but because they had a bit of money that would make",The War of the Worlds_24
36,for safety in their one little miserable skedaddle through the world.,The War of the Worlds_24
36,Lives insured and a bit invested for fear of accidents. And on,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"Sundays—fear of the hereafter. As if hell was built for rabbits! Well,",The War of the Worlds_24
36,"the Martians will just be a godsend to these. Nice roomy cages,",The War of the Worlds_24
36,"fattening food, careful breeding, no worry. After a week or so chasing",The War of the Worlds_24
36,"about the fields and lands on empty stomachs, they’ll come and be",The War of the Worlds_24
36,caught cheerful. They’ll be quite glad after a bit. They’ll wonder what,The War of the Worlds_24
36,people did before there were Martians to take care of them. And the bar,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"loafers, and mashers, and singers—I can imagine them. I can imagine",The War of the Worlds_24
36,"them,” he said, with a sort of sombre gratification. “There’ll be any",The War of the Worlds_24
36,amount of sentiment and religion loose among them. There’s hundreds of,The War of the Worlds_24
36,things I saw with my eyes that I’ve only begun to see clearly these,The War of the Worlds_24
36,last few days. There’s lots will take things as they are—fat and,The War of the Worlds_24
36,stupid; and lots will be worried by a sort of feeling that it’s all,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"wrong, and that they ought to be doing something. Now whenever things",The War of the Worlds_24
36,"are so that a lot of people feel they ought to be doing something, the",The War of the Worlds_24
36,"weak, and those who go weak with a lot of complicated thinking, always",The War of the Worlds_24
36,"make for a sort of do-nothing religion, very pious and superior, and",The War of the Worlds_24
36,submit to persecution and the will of the Lord. Very likely you’ve seen,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"the same thing. It’s energy in a gale of funk, and turned clean inside",The War of the Worlds_24
36,out. These cages will be full of psalms and hymns and piety. And those,The War of the Worlds_24
36,of a less simple sort will work in a bit of—what is it?—eroticism.”,The War of the Worlds_24
36,,The War of the Worlds_24
36,He paused.,The War of the Worlds_24
36,,The War of the Worlds_24
36,“Very likely these Martians will make pets of some of them; train them,The War of the Worlds_24
36,to do tricks—who knows?—get sentimental over the pet boy who grew up,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"and had to be killed. And some, maybe, they will train to hunt us.”",The War of the Worlds_24
36,,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"“No,” I cried, “that’s impossible! No human being——”",The War of the Worlds_24
36,,The War of the Worlds_24
36,“What’s the good of going on with such lies?” said the artilleryman.,The War of the Worlds_24
36,“There’s men who’d do it cheerful. What nonsense to pretend there,The War of the Worlds_24
36,isn’t!”,The War of the Worlds_24
36,,The War of the Worlds_24
36,And I succumbed to his conviction.,The War of the Worlds_24
36,,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"“If they come after me,” he said; “Lord, if they come after me!” and",The War of the Worlds_24
36,subsided into a grim meditation.,The War of the Worlds_24
36,,The War of the Worlds_24
36,I sat contemplating these things. I could find nothing to bring against,The War of the Worlds_24
36,this man’s reasoning. In the days before the invasion no one would have,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"questioned my intellectual superiority to his—I, a professed and",The War of the Worlds_24
36,"recognised writer on philosophical themes, and he, a common soldier;",The War of the Worlds_24
36,and yet he had already formulated a situation that I had scarcely,The War of the Worlds_24
36,realised.,The War of the Worlds_24
36,,The War of the Worlds_24
36,“What are you doing?” I said presently. “What plans have you made?”,The War of the Worlds_24
36,,The War of the Worlds_24
36,He hesitated.,The War of the Worlds_24
36,,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"“Well, it’s like this,” he said. “What have we to do? We have to invent",The War of the Worlds_24
36,"a sort of life where men can live and breed, and be sufficiently secure",The War of the Worlds_24
36,"to bring the children up. Yes—wait a bit, and I’ll make it clearer what",The War of the Worlds_24
36,I think ought to be done. The tame ones will go like all tame beasts;,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"in a few generations they’ll be big, beautiful, rich-blooded,",The War of the Worlds_24
36,stupid—rubbish! The risk is that we who keep wild will go,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"savage—degenerate into a sort of big, savage rat. . . . You see, how I",The War of the Worlds_24
36,mean to live is underground. I’ve been thinking about the drains. Of,The War of the Worlds_24
36,course those who don’t know drains think horrible things; but under,The War of the Worlds_24
36,this London are miles and miles—hundreds of miles—and a few days rain,The War of the Worlds_24
36,and London empty will leave them sweet and clean. The main drains are,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"big enough and airy enough for anyone. Then there’s cellars, vaults,",The War of the Worlds_24
36,"stores, from which bolting passages may be made to the drains. And the",The War of the Worlds_24
36,railway tunnels and subways. Eh? You begin to see? And we form a,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"band—able-bodied, clean-minded men. We’re not going to pick up any",The War of the Worlds_24
36,rubbish that drifts in. Weaklings go out again.”,The War of the Worlds_24
36,,The War of the Worlds_24
36,“As you meant me to go?”,The War of the Worlds_24
36,,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"“Well—I parleyed, didn’t I?”",The War of the Worlds_24
36,,The War of the Worlds_24
36,“We won’t quarrel about that. Go on.”,The War of the Worlds_24
36,,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"“Those who stop obey orders. Able-bodied, clean-minded women we want",The War of the Worlds_24
36,also—mothers and teachers. No lackadaisical ladies—no blasted rolling,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"eyes. We can’t have any weak or silly. Life is real again, and the",The War of the Worlds_24
36,useless and cumbersome and mischievous have to die. They ought to die.,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"They ought to be willing to die. It’s a sort of disloyalty, after all,",The War of the Worlds_24
36,"to live and taint the race. And they can’t be happy. Moreover, dying’s",The War of the Worlds_24
36,none so dreadful; it’s the funking makes it bad. And in all those,The War of the Worlds_24
36,places we shall gather. Our district will be London. And we may even be,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"able to keep a watch, and run about in the open when the Martians keep",The War of the Worlds_24
36,"away. Play cricket, perhaps. That’s how we shall save the race. Eh?",The War of the Worlds_24
36,It’s a possible thing? But saving the race is nothing in itself. As I,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"say, that’s only being rats. It’s saving our knowledge and adding to it",The War of the Worlds_24
36,"is the thing. There men like you come in. There’s books, there’s",The War of the Worlds_24
36,"models. We must make great safe places down deep, and get all the books",The War of the Worlds_24
36,"we can; not novels and poetry swipes, but ideas, science books. That’s",The War of the Worlds_24
36,where men like you come in. We must go to the British Museum and pick,The War of the Worlds_24
36,all those books through. Especially we must keep up our science—learn,The War of the Worlds_24
36,more. We must watch these Martians. Some of us must go as spies. When,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"it’s all working, perhaps I will. Get caught, I mean. And the great",The War of the Worlds_24
36,"thing is, we must leave the Martians alone. We mustn’t even steal. If",The War of the Worlds_24
36,"we get in their way, we clear out. We must show them we mean no harm.",The War of the Worlds_24
36,"Yes, I know. But they’re intelligent things, and they won’t hunt us",The War of the Worlds_24
36,"down if they have all they want, and think we’re just harmless vermin.”",The War of the Worlds_24
36,,The War of the Worlds_24
36,The artilleryman paused and laid a brown hand upon my arm.,The War of the Worlds_24
36,,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"“After all, it may not be so much we may have to learn before—Just",The War of the Worlds_24
36,imagine this: four or five of their fighting machines suddenly starting,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"off—Heat-Rays right and left, and not a Martian in ’em. Not a Martian",The War of the Worlds_24
36,"in ’em, but men—men who have learned the way how. It may be in my time,",The War of the Worlds_24
36,"even—those men. Fancy having one of them lovely things, with its",The War of the Worlds_24
36,Heat-Ray wide and free! Fancy having it in control! What would it,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"matter if you smashed to smithereens at the end of the run, after a",The War of the Worlds_24
36,bust like that? I reckon the Martians’ll open their beautiful eyes!,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"Can’t you see them, man? Can’t you see them hurrying, hurrying—puffing",The War of the Worlds_24
36,and blowing and hooting to their other mechanical affairs? Something,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"out of gear in every case. And swish, bang, rattle, swish! Just as they",The War of the Worlds_24
36,"are fumbling over it, _swish_ comes the Heat-Ray, and, behold! man has",The War of the Worlds_24
36,come back to his own.”,The War of the Worlds_24
36,,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"For a while the imaginative daring of the artilleryman, and the tone of",The War of the Worlds_24
36,"assurance and courage he assumed, completely dominated my mind. I",The War of the Worlds_24
36,believed unhesitatingly both in his forecast of human destiny and in,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"the practicability of his astonishing scheme, and the reader who thinks",The War of the Worlds_24
36,"me susceptible and foolish must contrast his position, reading steadily",The War of the Worlds_24
36,"with all his thoughts about his subject, and mine, crouching fearfully",The War of the Worlds_24
36,"in the bushes and listening, distracted by apprehension. We talked in",The War of the Worlds_24
36,"this manner through the early morning time, and later crept out of the",The War of the Worlds_24
36,"bushes, and, after scanning the sky for Martians, hurried precipitately",The War of the Worlds_24
36,to the house on Putney Hill where he had made his lair. It was the coal,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"cellar of the place, and when I saw the work he had spent a week",The War of the Worlds_24
36,"upon—it was a burrow scarcely ten yards long, which he designed to",The War of the Worlds_24
36,reach to the main drain on Putney Hill—I had my first inkling of the,The War of the Worlds_24
36,gulf between his dreams and his powers. Such a hole I could have dug in,The War of the Worlds_24
36,a day. But I believed in him sufficiently to work with him all that,The War of the Worlds_24
36,morning until past midday at his digging. We had a garden barrow and,The War of the Worlds_24
36,shot the earth we removed against the kitchen range. We refreshed,The War of the Worlds_24
36,ourselves with a tin of mock-turtle soup and wine from the neighbouring,The War of the Worlds_24
36,pantry. I found a curious relief from the aching strangeness of the,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"world in this steady labour. As we worked, I turned his project over in",The War of the Worlds_24
36,"my mind, and presently objections and doubts began to arise; but I",The War of the Worlds_24
36,"worked there all the morning, so glad was I to find myself with a",The War of the Worlds_24
36,purpose again. After working an hour I began to speculate on the,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"distance one had to go before the cloaca was reached, the chances we",The War of the Worlds_24
36,had of missing it altogether. My immediate trouble was why we should,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"dig this long tunnel, when it was possible to get into the drain at",The War of the Worlds_24
36,"once down one of the manholes, and work back to the house. It seemed to",The War of the Worlds_24
36,"me, too, that the house was inconveniently chosen, and required a",The War of the Worlds_24
36,needless length of tunnel. And just as I was beginning to face these,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"things, the artilleryman stopped digging, and looked at me.",The War of the Worlds_24
36,,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"“We’re working well,” he said. He put down his spade. “Let us knock off",The War of the Worlds_24
36,a bit” he said. “I think it’s time we reconnoitred from the roof of the,The War of the Worlds_24
36,house.”,The War of the Worlds_24
36,,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"I was for going on, and after a little hesitation he resumed his spade;",The War of the Worlds_24
36,"and then suddenly I was struck by a thought. I stopped, and so did he",The War of the Worlds_24
36,at once.,The War of the Worlds_24
36,,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"“Why were you walking about the common,” I said, “instead of being",The War of the Worlds_24
36,here?”,The War of the Worlds_24
36,,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"“Taking the air,” he said. “I was coming back. It’s safer by night.”",The War of the Worlds_24
36,,The War of the Worlds_24
36,“But the work?”,The War of the Worlds_24
36,,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"“Oh, one can’t always work,” he said, and in a flash I saw the man",The War of the Worlds_24
36,"plain. He hesitated, holding his spade. “We ought to reconnoitre now,”",The War of the Worlds_24
36,"he said, “because if any come near they may hear the spades and drop",The War of the Worlds_24
36,upon us unawares.”,The War of the Worlds_24
36,,The War of the Worlds_24
36,I was no longer disposed to object. We went together to the roof and,The War of the Worlds_24
36,stood on a ladder peeping out of the roof door. No Martians were to be,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"seen, and we ventured out on the tiles, and slipped down under shelter",The War of the Worlds_24
36,of the parapet.,The War of the Worlds_24
36,,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"From this position a shrubbery hid the greater portion of Putney, but",The War of the Worlds_24
36,"we could see the river below, a bubbly mass of red weed, and the low",The War of the Worlds_24
36,parts of Lambeth flooded and red. The red creeper swarmed up the trees,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"about the old palace, and their branches stretched gaunt and dead, and",The War of the Worlds_24
36,"set with shrivelled leaves, from amid its clusters. It was strange how",The War of the Worlds_24
36,entirely dependent both these things were upon flowing water for their,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"propagation. About us neither had gained a footing; laburnums, pink",The War of the Worlds_24
36,"mays, snowballs, and trees of arbor-vitae, rose out of laurels and",The War of the Worlds_24
36,"hydrangeas, green and brilliant into the sunlight. Beyond Kensington",The War of the Worlds_24
36,"dense smoke was rising, and that and a blue haze hid the northward",The War of the Worlds_24
36,hills.,The War of the Worlds_24
36,,The War of the Worlds_24
36,The artilleryman began to tell me of the sort of people who still,The War of the Worlds_24
36,remained in London.,The War of the Worlds_24
36,,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"“One night last week,” he said, “some fools got the electric light in",The War of the Worlds_24
36,"order, and there was all Regent Street and the Circus ablaze, crowded",The War of the Worlds_24
36,"with painted and ragged drunkards, men and women, dancing and shouting",The War of the Worlds_24
36,till dawn. A man who was there told me. And as the day came they became,The War of the Worlds_24
36,aware of a fighting-machine standing near by the Langham and looking,The War of the Worlds_24
36,down at them. Heaven knows how long he had been there. It must have,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"given some of them a nasty turn. He came down the road towards them,",The War of the Worlds_24
36,and picked up nearly a hundred too drunk or frightened to run away.”,The War of the Worlds_24
36,,The War of the Worlds_24
36,Grotesque gleam of a time no history will ever fully describe!,The War of the Worlds_24
36,,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"From that, in answer to my questions, he came round to his grandiose",The War of the Worlds_24
36,plans again. He grew enthusiastic. He talked so eloquently of the,The War of the Worlds_24
36,possibility of capturing a fighting-machine that I more than half,The War of the Worlds_24
36,believed in him again. But now that I was beginning to understand,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"something of his quality, I could divine the stress he laid on doing",The War of the Worlds_24
36,nothing precipitately. And I noted that now there was no question that,The War of the Worlds_24
36,he personally was to capture and fight the great machine.,The War of the Worlds_24
36,,The War of the Worlds_24
36,After a time we went down to the cellar. Neither of us seemed disposed,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"to resume digging, and when he suggested a meal, I was nothing loath.",The War of the Worlds_24
36,"He became suddenly very generous, and when we had eaten he went away",The War of the Worlds_24
36,"and returned with some excellent cigars. We lit these, and his optimism",The War of the Worlds_24

36,"And pursuant to this idea of a holiday, he insisted upon playing cards",The War of the Worlds_24
36,"after we had eaten. He taught me euchre, and after dividing London",The War of the Worlds_24
36,"between us, I taking the northern side and he the southern, we played",The War of the Worlds_24
36,for parish points. Grotesque and foolish as this will seem to the sober,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"reader, it is absolutely true, and what is more remarkable, I found the",The War of the Worlds_24
36,card game and several others we played extremely interesting.,The War of the Worlds_24
36,,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"Strange mind of man! that, with our species upon the edge of",The War of the Worlds_24
36,"extermination or appalling degradation, with no clear prospect before",The War of the Worlds_24
36,"us but the chance of a horrible death, we could sit following the",The War of the Worlds_24
36,"chance of this painted pasteboard, and playing the “joker” with vivid",The War of the Worlds_24
36,"delight. Afterwards he taught me poker, and I beat him at three tough",The War of the Worlds_24
36,"chess games. When dark came we decided to take the risk, and lit a",The War of the Worlds_24
36,lamp.,The War of the Worlds_24
36,,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"After an interminable string of games, we supped, and the artilleryman",The War of the Worlds_24
36,finished the champagne. We went on smoking the cigars. He was no longer,The War of the Worlds_24
36,the energetic regenerator of his species I had encountered in the,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"morning. He was still optimistic, but it was a less kinetic, a more",The War of the Worlds_24
36,"thoughtful optimism. I remember he wound up with my health, proposed in",The War of the Worlds_24
36,a speech of small variety and considerable intermittence. I took a,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"cigar, and went upstairs to look at the lights of which he had spoken",The War of the Worlds_24
36,that blazed so greenly along the Highgate hills.,The War of the Worlds_24
36,,The War of the Worlds_24
36,At first I stared unintelligently across the London valley. The,The War of the Worlds_24
36,northern hills were shrouded in darkness; the fires near Kensington,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"glowed redly, and now and then an orange-red tongue of flame flashed up",The War of the Worlds_24
36,and vanished in the deep blue night. All the rest of London was black.,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"Then, nearer, I perceived a strange light, a pale, violet-purple",The War of the Worlds_24
36,"fluorescent glow, quivering under the night breeze. For a space I could",The War of the Worlds_24
36,"not understand it, and then I knew that it must be the red weed from",The War of the Worlds_24
36,which this faint irradiation proceeded. With that realisation my,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"dormant sense of wonder, my sense of the proportion of things, awoke",The War of the Worlds_24
36,"again. I glanced from that to Mars, red and clear, glowing high in the",The War of the Worlds_24
36,"west, and then gazed long and earnestly at the darkness of Hampstead",The War of the Worlds_24
36,and Highgate.,The War of the Worlds_24
36,,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"I remained a very long time upon the roof, wondering at the grotesque",The War of the Worlds_24
36,changes of the day. I recalled my mental states from the midnight,The War of the Worlds_24
36,prayer to the foolish card-playing. I had a violent revulsion of,The War of the Worlds_24
36,feeling. I remember I flung away the cigar with a certain wasteful,The War of the Worlds_24
36,symbolism. My folly came to me with glaring exaggeration. I seemed a,The War of the Worlds_24
36,traitor to my wife and to my kind; I was filled with remorse. I,The War of the Worlds_24
36,resolved to leave this strange undisciplined dreamer of great things to,The War of the Worlds_24
36,"his drink and gluttony, and to go on into London. There, it seemed to",The War of the Worlds_24
36,"me, I had the best chance of learning what the Martians and my",The War of the Worlds_24
36,fellowmen were doing. I was still upon the roof when the late moon,The War of the Worlds_24

36,,The War of the Worlds_25
36,,The War of the Worlds_25
36,"After I had parted from the artilleryman, I went down the hill, and by",The War of the Worlds_25
36,the High Street across the bridge to Fulham. The red weed was,The War of the Worlds_25
36,"tumultuous at that time, and nearly choked the bridge roadway; but its",The War of the Worlds_25
36,fronds were already whitened in patches by the spreading disease that,The War of the Worlds_25
36,presently removed it so swiftly.,The War of the Worlds_25
36,,The War of the Worlds_25
36,At the corner of the lane that runs to Putney Bridge station I found a,The War of the Worlds_25
36,"man lying. He was as black as a sweep with the black dust, alive, but",The War of the Worlds_25
36,helplessly and speechlessly drunk. I could get nothing from him but,The War of the Worlds_25
36,curses and furious lunges at my head. I think I should have stayed by,The War of the Worlds_25
36,him but for the brutal expression of his face.,The War of the Worlds_25
36,,The War of the Worlds_25
36,"There was black dust along the roadway from the bridge onwards, and it",The War of the Worlds_25
36,grew thicker in Fulham. The streets were horribly quiet. I got,The War of the Worlds_25
36,"food—sour, hard, and mouldy, but quite eatable—in a baker’s shop here.",The War of the Worlds_25
36,"Some way towards Walham Green the streets became clear of powder, and I",The War of the Worlds_25
36,passed a white terrace of houses on fire; the noise of the burning was,The War of the Worlds_25
36,"an absolute relief. Going on towards Brompton, the streets were quiet",The War of the Worlds_25
36,again.,The War of the Worlds_25
36,,The War of the Worlds_25
36,Here I came once more upon the black powder in the streets and upon,The War of the Worlds_25
36,dead bodies. I saw altogether about a dozen in the length of the Fulham,The War of the Worlds_25
36,"Road. They had been dead many days, so that I hurried quickly past",The War of the Worlds_25
36,"them. The black powder covered them over, and softened their outlines.",The War of the Worlds_25
36,One or two had been disturbed by dogs.,The War of the Worlds_25
36,,The War of the Worlds_25
36,"Where there was no black powder, it was curiously like a Sunday in the",The War of the Worlds_25
36,"City, with the closed shops, the houses locked up and the blinds drawn,",The War of the Worlds_25
36,"the desertion, and the stillness. In some places plunderers had been at",The War of the Worlds_25
36,"work, but rarely at other than the provision and wine shops. A",The War of the Worlds_25
36,"jeweller’s window had been broken open in one place, but apparently the",The War of the Worlds_25
36,"thief had been disturbed, and a number of gold chains and a watch lay",The War of the Worlds_25
36,scattered on the pavement. I did not trouble to touch them. Farther on,The War of the Worlds_25
36,was a tattered woman in a heap on a doorstep; the hand that hung over,The War of the Worlds_25
36,"her knee was gashed and bled down her rusty brown dress, and a smashed",The War of the Worlds_25
36,magnum of champagne formed a pool across the pavement. She seemed,The War of the Worlds_25
36,"asleep, but she was dead.",The War of the Worlds_25
36,,The War of the Worlds_25
36,"The farther I penetrated into London, the profounder grew the",The War of the Worlds_25
36,stillness. But it was not so much the stillness of death—it was the,The War of the Worlds_25
36,"stillness of suspense, of expectation. At any time the destruction that",The War of the Worlds_25
36,"had already singed the northwestern borders of the metropolis, and had",The War of the Worlds_25
36,"annihilated Ealing and Kilburn, might strike among these houses and",The War of the Worlds_25
36,leave them smoking ruins. It was a city condemned and derelict. . . .,The War of the Worlds_25
36,,The War of the Worlds_25
36,In South Kensington the streets were clear of dead and of black powder.,The War of the Worlds_25
36,It was near South Kensington that I first heard the howling. It crept,The War of the Worlds_25
36,almost imperceptibly upon my senses. It was a sobbing alternation of,The War of the Worlds_25
36,"two notes, “Ulla, ulla, ulla, ulla,” keeping on perpetually. When I",The War of the Worlds_25
36,"passed streets that ran northward it grew in volume, and houses and",The War of the Worlds_25
36,buildings seemed to deaden and cut it off again. It came in a full tide,The War of the Worlds_25
36,"down Exhibition Road. I stopped, staring towards Kensington Gardens,",The War of the Worlds_25
36,"wondering at this strange, remote wailing. It was as if that mighty",The War of the Worlds_25
36,desert of houses had found a voice for its fear and solitude.,The War of the Worlds_25
36,,The War of the Worlds_25
36,"“Ulla, ulla, ulla, ulla,” wailed that superhuman note—great waves of",The War of the Worlds_25
36,"sound sweeping down the broad, sunlit roadway, between the tall",The War of the Worlds_25
36,"buildings on each side. I turned northwards, marvelling, towards the",The War of the Worlds_25
36,iron gates of Hyde Park. I had half a mind to break into the Natural,The War of the Worlds_25
36,"History Museum and find my way up to the summits of the towers, in",The War of the Worlds_25
36,"order to see across the park. But I decided to keep to the ground,",The War of the Worlds_25
36,"where quick hiding was possible, and so went on up the Exhibition Road.",The War of the Worlds_25
36,"All the large mansions on each side of the road were empty and still,",The War of the Worlds_25
36,"and my footsteps echoed against the sides of the houses. At the top,",The War of the Worlds_25
36,"near the park gate, I came upon a strange sight—a bus overturned, and",The War of the Worlds_25
36,"the skeleton of a horse picked clean. I puzzled over this for a time,",The War of the Worlds_25
36,and then went on to the bridge over the Serpentine. The voice grew,The War of the Worlds_25
36,"stronger and stronger, though I could see nothing above the housetops",The War of the Worlds_25
36,"on the north side of the park, save a haze of smoke to the northwest.",The War of the Worlds_25
36,,The War of the Worlds_25
36,"“Ulla, ulla, ulla, ulla,” cried the voice, coming, as it seemed to me,",The War of the Worlds_25
36,from the district about Regent’s Park. The desolating cry worked upon,The War of the Worlds_25
36,my mind. The mood that had sustained me passed. The wailing took,The War of the Worlds_25
36,"possession of me. I found I was intensely weary, footsore, and now",The War of the Worlds_25
36,again hungry and thirsty.,The War of the Worlds_25
36,,The War of the Worlds_25
36,It was already past noon. Why was I wandering alone in this city of the,The War of the Worlds_25
36,"dead? Why was I alone when all London was lying in state, and in its",The War of the Worlds_25
36,black shroud? I felt intolerably lonely. My mind ran on old friends,The War of the Worlds_25
36,that I had forgotten for years. I thought of the poisons in the,The War of the Worlds_25
36,"chemists’ shops, of the liquors the wine merchants stored; I recalled",The War of the Worlds_25
36,"the two sodden creatures of despair, who so far as I knew, shared the",The War of the Worlds_25
36,city with myself. . . .,The War of the Worlds_25
36,,The War of the Worlds_25
36,"I came into Oxford Street by the Marble Arch, and here again were black",The War of the Worlds_25
36,"powder and several bodies, and an evil, ominous smell from the gratings",The War of the Worlds_25
36,of the cellars of some of the houses. I grew very thirsty after the,The War of the Worlds_25
36,heat of my long walk. With infinite trouble I managed to break into a,The War of the Worlds_25
36,"public-house and get food and drink. I was weary after eating, and went",The War of the Worlds_25
36,"into the parlour behind the bar, and slept on a black horsehair sofa I",The War of the Worlds_25
36,found there.,The War of the Worlds_25
36,,The War of the Worlds_25
36,"I awoke to find that dismal howling still in my ears, “Ulla, ulla,",The War of the Worlds_25
36,"ulla, ulla.” It was now dusk, and after I had routed out some biscuits",The War of the Worlds_25
36,"and a cheese in the bar—there was a meat safe, but it contained nothing",The War of the Worlds_25
36,but maggots—I wandered on through the silent residential squares to,The War of the Worlds_25
36,Baker Street—Portman Square is the only one I can name—and so came out,The War of the Worlds_25
36,at last upon Regent’s Park. And as I emerged from the top of Baker,The War of the Worlds_25
36,"Street, I saw far away over the trees in the clearness of the sunset",The War of the Worlds_25
36,the hood of the Martian giant from which this howling proceeded. I was,The War of the Worlds_25
36,not terrified. I came upon him as if it were a matter of course. I,The War of the Worlds_25
36,"watched him for some time, but he did not move. He appeared to be",The War of the Worlds_25
36,"standing and yelling, for no reason that I could discover.",The War of the Worlds_25
36,,The War of the Worlds_25
36,"I tried to formulate a plan of action. That perpetual sound of “Ulla,",The War of the Worlds_25
36,"ulla, ulla, ulla,” confused my mind. Perhaps I was too tired to be very",The War of the Worlds_25
36,fearful. Certainly I was more curious to know the reason of this,The War of the Worlds_25
36,monotonous crying than afraid. I turned back away from the park and,The War of the Worlds_25
36,"struck into Park Road, intending to skirt the park, went along under",The War of the Worlds_25
36,"the shelter of the terraces, and got a view of this stationary, howling",The War of the Worlds_25
36,Martian from the direction of St. John’s Wood. A couple of hundred,The War of the Worlds_25
36,"yards out of Baker Street I heard a yelping chorus, and saw, first a",The War of the Worlds_25
36,dog with a piece of putrescent red meat in his jaws coming headlong,The War of the Worlds_25
36,"towards me, and then a pack of starving mongrels in pursuit of him. He",The War of the Worlds_25
36,"made a wide curve to avoid me, as though he feared I might prove a",The War of the Worlds_25
36,"fresh competitor. As the yelping died away down the silent road, the",The War of the Worlds_25
36,"wailing sound of “Ulla, ulla, ulla, ulla,” reasserted itself.",The War of the Worlds_25
36,,The War of the Worlds_25
36,I came upon the wrecked handling-machine halfway to St. John’s Wood,The War of the Worlds_25
36,station. At first I thought a house had fallen across the road. It was,The War of the Worlds_25
36,"only as I clambered among the ruins that I saw, with a start, this",The War of the Worlds_25
36,"mechanical Samson lying, with its tentacles bent and smashed and",The War of the Worlds_25
36,"twisted, among the ruins it had made. The forepart was shattered. It",The War of the Worlds_25
36,"seemed as if it had driven blindly straight at the house, and had been",The War of the Worlds_25
36,overwhelmed in its overthrow. It seemed to me then that this might have,The War of the Worlds_25
36,happened by a handling-machine escaping from the guidance of its,The War of the Worlds_25
36,"Martian. I could not clamber among the ruins to see it, and the",The War of the Worlds_25
36,twilight was now so far advanced that the blood with which its seat was,The War of the Worlds_25
36,"smeared, and the gnawed gristle of the Martian that the dogs had left,",The War of the Worlds_25
36,were invisible to me.,The War of the Worlds_25
36,,The War of the Worlds_25
36,"Wondering still more at all that I had seen, I pushed on towards",The War of the Worlds_25
36,"Primrose Hill. Far away, through a gap in the trees, I saw a second",The War of the Worlds_25
36,"Martian, as motionless as the first, standing in the park towards the",The War of the Worlds_25
36,"Zoological Gardens, and silent. A little beyond the ruins about the",The War of the Worlds_25
36,"smashed handling-machine I came upon the red weed again, and found the",The War of the Worlds_25
36,"Regent’s Canal, a spongy mass of dark-red vegetation.",The War of the Worlds_25
36,,The War of the Worlds_25
36,"As I crossed the bridge, the sound of “Ulla, ulla, ulla, ulla,” ceased.",The War of the Worlds_25
36,"It was, as it were, cut off. The silence came like a thunderclap.",The War of the Worlds_25
36,,The War of the Worlds_25
36,The dusky houses about me stood faint and tall and dim; the trees,The War of the Worlds_25
36,towards the park were growing black. All about me the red weed,The War of the Worlds_25
36,"clambered among the ruins, writhing to get above me in the dimness.",The War of the Worlds_25
36,"Night, the mother of fear and mystery, was coming upon me. But while",The War of the Worlds_25
36,"that voice sounded the solitude, the desolation, had been endurable; by",The War of the Worlds_25
36,"virtue of it London had still seemed alive, and the sense of life about",The War of the Worlds_25
36,"me had upheld me. Then suddenly a change, the passing of something—I",The War of the Worlds_25
36,knew not what—and then a stillness that could be felt. Nothing but this,The War of the Worlds_25
36,gaunt quiet.,The War of the Worlds_25
36,,The War of the Worlds_25
36,London about me gazed at me spectrally. The windows in the white houses,The War of the Worlds_25
36,were like the eye sockets of skulls. About me my imagination found a,The War of the Worlds_25
36,"thousand noiseless enemies moving. Terror seized me, a horror of my",The War of the Worlds_25
36,temerity. In front of me the road became pitchy black as though it was,The War of the Worlds_25
36,"tarred, and I saw a contorted shape lying across the pathway. I could",The War of the Worlds_25
36,"not bring myself to go on. I turned down St. John’s Wood Road, and ran",The War of the Worlds_25
36,headlong from this unendurable stillness towards Kilburn. I hid from,The War of the Worlds_25
36,"the night and the silence, until long after midnight, in a cabmen’s",The War of the Worlds_25
36,"shelter in Harrow Road. But before the dawn my courage returned, and",The War of the Worlds_25
36,while the stars were still in the sky I turned once more towards,The War of the Worlds_25
36,"Regent’s Park. I missed my way among the streets, and presently saw",The War of the Worlds_25
36,"down a long avenue, in the half-light of the early dawn, the curve of",The War of the Worlds_25
36,"Primrose Hill. On the summit, towering up to the fading stars, was a",The War of the Worlds_25
36,"third Martian, erect and motionless like the others.",The War of the Worlds_25
36,,The War of the Worlds_25
36,An insane resolve possessed me. I would die and end it. And I would,The War of the Worlds_25
36,save myself even the trouble of killing myself. I marched on recklessly,The War of the Worlds_25
36,"towards this Titan, and then, as I drew nearer and the light grew, I",The War of the Worlds_25
36,saw that a multitude of black birds was circling and clustering about,The War of the Worlds_25
36,"the hood. At that my heart gave a bound, and I began running along the",The War of the Worlds_25
36,road.,The War of the Worlds_25
36,,The War of the Worlds_25
36,I hurried through the red weed that choked St. Edmund’s Terrace (I,The War of the Worlds_25
36,waded breast-high across a torrent of water that was rushing down from,The War of the Worlds_25
36,"the waterworks towards the Albert Road), and emerged upon the grass",The War of the Worlds_25
36,before the rising of the sun. Great mounds had been heaped about the,The War of the Worlds_25
36,"crest of the hill, making a huge redoubt of it—it was the final and",The War of the Worlds_25
36,largest place the Martians had made—and from behind these heaps there,The War of the Worlds_25
36,rose a thin smoke against the sky. Against the sky line an eager dog,The War of the Worlds_25
36,ran and disappeared. The thought that had flashed into my mind grew,The War of the Worlds_25
36,"real, grew credible. I felt no fear, only a wild, trembling exultation,",The War of the Worlds_25
36,as I ran up the hill towards the motionless monster. Out of the hood,The War of the Worlds_25
36,"hung lank shreds of brown, at which the hungry birds pecked and tore.",The War of the Worlds_25
36,,The War of the Worlds_25
36,In another moment I had scrambled up the earthen rampart and stood upon,The War of the Worlds_25
36,"its crest, and the interior of the redoubt was below me. A mighty space",The War of the Worlds_25
36,"it was, with gigantic machines here and there within it, huge mounds of",The War of the Worlds_25
36,"material and strange shelter places. And scattered about it, some in",The War of the Worlds_25
36,"their overturned war-machines, some in the now rigid handling-machines,",The War of the Worlds_25
36,"and a dozen of them stark and silent and laid in a row, were the",The War of the Worlds_25
36,Martians—_dead_!—slain by the putrefactive and disease bacteria against,The War of the Worlds_25
36,which their systems were unprepared; slain as the red weed was being,The War of the Worlds_25
36,"slain; slain, after all man’s devices had failed, by the humblest",The War of the Worlds_25
36,"things that God, in his wisdom, has put upon this earth.",The War of the Worlds_25
36,,The War of the Worlds_25
36,"For so it had come about, as indeed I and many men might have foreseen",The War of the Worlds_25
36,had not terror and disaster blinded our minds. These germs of disease,The War of the Worlds_25
36,have taken toll of humanity since the beginning of things—taken toll of,The War of the Worlds_25
36,our prehuman ancestors since life began here. But by virtue of this,The War of the Worlds_25
36,natural selection of our kind we have developed resisting power; to no,The War of the Worlds_25
36,"germs do we succumb without a struggle, and to many—those that cause",The War of the Worlds_25
36,"putrefaction in dead matter, for instance—our living frames are",The War of the Worlds_25
36,"altogether immune. But there are no bacteria in Mars, and directly",The War of the Worlds_25
36,"these invaders arrived, directly they drank and fed, our microscopic",The War of the Worlds_25
36,allies began to work their overthrow. Already when I watched them they,The War of the Worlds_25
36,"were irrevocably doomed, dying and rotting even as they went to and",The War of the Worlds_25
36,fro. It was inevitable. By the toll of a billion deaths man has bought,The War of the Worlds_25
36,"his birthright of the earth, and it is his against all comers; it would",The War of the Worlds_25
36,still be his were the Martians ten times as mighty as they are. For,The War of the Worlds_25
36,neither do men live nor die in vain.,The War of the Worlds_25
36,,The War of the Worlds_25
36,"Here and there they were scattered, nearly fifty altogether, in that",The War of the Worlds_25
36,"great gulf they had made, overtaken by a death that must have seemed to",The War of the Worlds_25
36,them as incomprehensible as any death could be. To me also at that time,The War of the Worlds_25
36,this death was incomprehensible. All I knew was that these things that,The War of the Worlds_25
36,had been alive and so terrible to men were dead. For a moment I,The War of the Worlds_25
36,"believed that the destruction of Sennacherib had been repeated, that",The War of the Worlds_25
36,"God had repented, that the Angel of Death had slain them in the night.",The War of the Worlds_25
36,,The War of the Worlds_25
36,"I stood staring into the pit, and my heart lightened gloriously, even",The War of the Worlds_25
36,as the rising sun struck the world to fire about me with his rays. The,The War of the Worlds_25
36,"pit was still in darkness; the mighty engines, so great and wonderful",The War of the Worlds_25
36,"in their power and complexity, so unearthly in their tortuous forms,",The War of the Worlds_25
36,rose weird and vague and strange out of the shadows towards the light.,The War of the Worlds_25
36,"A multitude of dogs, I could hear, fought over the bodies that lay",The War of the Worlds_25
36,"darkly in the depth of the pit, far below me. Across the pit on its",The War of the Worlds_25
36,"farther lip, flat and vast and strange, lay the great flying-machine",The War of the Worlds_25
36,with which they had been experimenting upon our denser atmosphere when,The War of the Worlds_25
36,decay and death arrested them. Death had come not a day too soon. At,The War of the Worlds_25
36,the sound of a cawing overhead I looked up at the huge fighting-machine,The War of the Worlds_25
36,"that would fight no more for ever, at the tattered red shreds of flesh",The War of the Worlds_25
36,that dripped down upon the overturned seats on the summit of Primrose,The War of the Worlds_25
36,Hill.,The War of the Worlds_25
36,,The War of the Worlds_25
36,"I turned and looked down the slope of the hill to where, enhaloed now",The War of the Worlds_25
36,"in birds, stood those other two Martians that I had seen overnight,",The War of the Worlds_25
36,"just as death had overtaken them. The one had died, even as it had been",The War of the Worlds_25
36,"crying to its companions; perhaps it was the last to die, and its voice",The War of the Worlds_25
36,had gone on perpetually until the force of its machinery was exhausted.,The War of the Worlds_25
36,"They glittered now, harmless tripod towers of shining metal, in the",The War of the Worlds_25
36,brightness of the rising sun.,The War of the Worlds_25
36,,The War of the Worlds_25
36,"All about the pit, and saved as by a miracle from everlasting",The War of the Worlds_25
36,"destruction, stretched the great Mother of Cities. Those who have only",The War of the Worlds_25
36,seen London veiled in her sombre robes of smoke can scarcely imagine,The War of the Worlds_25
36,the naked clearness and beauty of the silent wilderness of houses.,The War of the Worlds_25
36,,The War of the Worlds_25
36,"Eastward, over the blackened ruins of the Albert Terrace and the",The War of the Worlds_25
36,"splintered spire of the church, the sun blazed dazzling in a clear sky,",The War of the Worlds_25
36,and here and there some facet in the great wilderness of roofs caught,The War of the Worlds_25
36,the light and glared with a white intensity.,The War of the Worlds_25
36,,The War of the Worlds_25
36,"Northward were Kilburn and Hampsted, blue and crowded with houses;",The War of the Worlds_25
36,"westward the great city was dimmed; and southward, beyond the Martians,",The War of the Worlds_25
36,"the green waves of Regent’s Park, the Langham Hotel, the dome of the",The War of the Worlds_25
36,"Albert Hall, the Imperial Institute, and the giant mansions of the",The War of the Worlds_25
36,"Brompton Road came out clear and little in the sunrise, the jagged",The War of the Worlds_25
36,ruins of Westminster rising hazily beyond. Far away and blue were the,The War of the Worlds_25
36,"Surrey hills, and the towers of the Crystal Palace glittered like two",The War of the Worlds_25
36,"silver rods. The dome of St. Paul’s was dark against the sunrise, and",The War of the Worlds_25
36,"injured, I saw for the first time, by a huge gaping cavity on its",The War of the Worlds_25
36,western side.,The War of the Worlds_25
36,,The War of the Worlds_25
36,And as I looked at this wide expanse of houses and factories and,The War of the Worlds_25
36,"churches, silent and abandoned; as I thought of the multitudinous hopes",The War of the Worlds_25
36,"and efforts, the innumerable hosts of lives that had gone to build this",The War of the Worlds_25
36,"human reef, and of the swift and ruthless destruction that had hung",The War of the Worlds_25
36,"over it all; when I realised that the shadow had been rolled back, and",The War of the Worlds_25
36,"that men might still live in the streets, and this dear vast dead city",The War of the Worlds_25
36,"of mine be once more alive and powerful, I felt a wave of emotion that",The War of the Worlds_25
36,was near akin to tears.,The War of the Worlds_25
36,,The War of the Worlds_25
36,The torment was over. Even that day the healing would begin. The,The War of the Worlds_25
36,"survivors of the people scattered over the country—leaderless, lawless,",The War of the Worlds_25
36,"foodless, like sheep without a shepherd—the thousands who had fled by",The War of the Worlds_25
36,"sea, would begin to return; the pulse of life, growing stronger and",The War of the Worlds_25
36,"stronger, would beat again in the empty streets and pour across the",The War of the Worlds_25
36,"vacant squares. Whatever destruction was done, the hand of the",The War of the Worlds_25
36,"destroyer was stayed. All the gaunt wrecks, the blackened skeletons of",The War of the Worlds_25
36,"houses that stared so dismally at the sunlit grass of the hill, would",The War of the Worlds_25
36,presently be echoing with the hammers of the restorers and ringing with,The War of the Worlds_25
36,the tapping of their trowels. At the thought I extended my hands,The War of the Worlds_25
36,"towards the sky and began thanking God. In a year, thought I—in a year.",The War of the Worlds_25
36,. . .,The War of the Worlds_25

36,,The War of the Worlds_26
36,"And now comes the strangest thing in my story. Yet, perhaps, it is not",The War of the Worlds_26
36,"altogether strange. I remember, clearly and coldly and vividly, all",The War of the Worlds_26
36,that I did that day until the time that I stood weeping and praising,The War of the Worlds_26
36,God upon the summit of Primrose Hill. And then I forget.,The War of the Worlds_26
36,,The War of the Worlds_26
36,"Of the next three days I know nothing. I have learned since that, so",The War of the Worlds_26
36,"far from my being the first discoverer of the Martian overthrow,",The War of the Worlds_26
36,several such wanderers as myself had already discovered this on the,The War of the Worlds_26
36,"previous night. One man—the first—had gone to St. Martin’s-le-Grand,",The War of the Worlds_26
36,"and, while I sheltered in the cabmen’s hut, had contrived to telegraph",The War of the Worlds_26
36,to Paris. Thence the joyful news had flashed all over the world; a,The War of the Worlds_26
36,"thousand cities, chilled by ghastly apprehensions, suddenly flashed",The War of the Worlds_26
36,"into frantic illuminations; they knew of it in Dublin, Edinburgh,",The War of the Worlds_26
36,"Manchester, Birmingham, at the time when I stood upon the verge of the",The War of the Worlds_26
36,"pit. Already men, weeping with joy, as I have heard, shouting and",The War of the Worlds_26
36,"staying their work to shake hands and shout, were making up trains,",The War of the Worlds_26
36,"even as near as Crewe, to descend upon London. The church bells that",The War of the Worlds_26
36,"had ceased a fortnight since suddenly caught the news, until all",The War of the Worlds_26
36,"England was bell-ringing. Men on cycles, lean-faced, unkempt, scorched",The War of the Worlds_26
36,"along every country lane shouting of unhoped deliverance, shouting to",The War of the Worlds_26
36,"gaunt, staring figures of despair. And for the food! Across the",The War of the Worlds_26
36,"Channel, across the Irish Sea, across the Atlantic, corn, bread, and",The War of the Worlds_26
36,meat were tearing to our relief. All the shipping in the world seemed,The War of the Worlds_26
36,going Londonward in those days. But of all this I have no memory. I,The War of the Worlds_26
36,"drifted—a demented man. I found myself in a house of kindly people, who",The War of the Worlds_26
36,"had found me on the third day wandering, weeping, and raving through",The War of the Worlds_26
36,the streets of St. John’s Wood. They have told me since that I was,The War of the Worlds_26
36,singing some insane doggerel about “The Last Man Left Alive! Hurrah!,The War of the Worlds_26
36,"The Last Man Left Alive!” Troubled as they were with their own affairs,",The War of the Worlds_26
36,"these people, whose name, much as I would like to express my gratitude",The War of the Worlds_26
36,"to them, I may not even give here, nevertheless cumbered themselves",The War of the Worlds_26
36,"with me, sheltered me, and protected me from myself. Apparently they",The War of the Worlds_26
36,had learned something of my story from me during the days of my lapse.,The War of the Worlds_26
36,,The War of the Worlds_26
36,"Very gently, when my mind was assured again, did they break to me what",The War of the Worlds_26
36,they had learned of the fate of Leatherhead. Two days after I was,The War of the Worlds_26
36,"imprisoned it had been destroyed, with every soul in it, by a Martian.",The War of the Worlds_26
36,"He had swept it out of existence, as it seemed, without any",The War of the Worlds_26
36,"provocation, as a boy might crush an ant hill, in the mere wantonness",The War of the Worlds_26
36,of power.,The War of the Worlds_26
36,,The War of the Worlds_26
36,"I was a lonely man, and they were very kind to me. I was a lonely man",The War of the Worlds_26
36,"and a sad one, and they bore with me. I remained with them four days",The War of the Worlds_26
36,"after my recovery. All that time I felt a vague, a growing craving to",The War of the Worlds_26
36,look once more on whatever remained of the little life that seemed so,The War of the Worlds_26
36,happy and bright in my past. It was a mere hopeless desire to feast,The War of the Worlds_26
36,upon my misery. They dissuaded me. They did all they could to divert me,The War of the Worlds_26
36,"from this morbidity. But at last I could resist the impulse no longer,",The War of the Worlds_26
36,"and, promising faithfully to return to them, and parting, as I will",The War of the Worlds_26
36,"confess, from these four-day friends with tears, I went out again into",The War of the Worlds_26
36,the streets that had lately been so dark and strange and empty.,The War of the Worlds_26
36,,The War of the Worlds_26
36,Already they were busy with returning people; in places even there were,The War of the Worlds_26
36,"shops open, and I saw a drinking fountain running water.",The War of the Worlds_26
36,,The War of the Worlds_26
36,I remember how mockingly bright the day seemed as I went back on my,The War of the Worlds_26
36,"melancholy pilgrimage to the little house at Woking, how busy the",The War of the Worlds_26
36,streets and vivid the moving life about me. So many people were abroad,The War of the Worlds_26
36,"everywhere, busied in a thousand activities, that it seemed incredible",The War of the Worlds_26
36,that any great proportion of the population could have been slain. But,The War of the Worlds_26
36,"then I noticed how yellow were the skins of the people I met, how",The War of the Worlds_26
36,"shaggy the hair of the men, how large and bright their eyes, and that",The War of the Worlds_26
36,every other man still wore his dirty rags. Their faces seemed all with,The War of the Worlds_26
36,one of two expressions—a leaping exultation and energy or a grim,The War of the Worlds_26
36,"resolution. Save for the expression of the faces, London seemed a city",The War of the Worlds_26
36,of tramps. The vestries were indiscriminately distributing bread sent,The War of the Worlds_26
36,us by the French government. The ribs of the few horses showed,The War of the Worlds_26
36,dismally. Haggard special constables with white badges stood at the,The War of the Worlds_26
36,corners of every street. I saw little of the mischief wrought by the,The War of the Worlds_26
36,"Martians until I reached Wellington Street, and there I saw the red",The War of the Worlds_26
36,weed clambering over the buttresses of Waterloo Bridge.,The War of the Worlds_26
36,,The War of the Worlds_26
36,"At the corner of the bridge, too, I saw one of the common contrasts of",The War of the Worlds_26
36,that grotesque time—a sheet of paper flaunting against a thicket of the,The War of the Worlds_26
36,"red weed, transfixed by a stick that kept it in place. It was the",The War of the Worlds_26
36,placard of the first newspaper to resume publication—the _Daily Mail_.,The War of the Worlds_26
36,I bought a copy for a blackened shilling I found in my pocket. Most of,The War of the Worlds_26
36,"it was in blank, but the solitary compositor who did the thing had",The War of the Worlds_26
36,amused himself by making a grotesque scheme of advertisement stereo on,The War of the Worlds_26
36,the back page. The matter he printed was emotional; the news,The War of the Worlds_26
36,organisation had not as yet found its way back. I learned nothing fresh,The War of the Worlds_26
36,except that already in one week the examination of the Martian,The War of the Worlds_26
36,"mechanisms had yielded astonishing results. Among other things, the",The War of the Worlds_26
36,"article assured me what I did not believe at the time, that the “Secret",The War of the Worlds_26
36,"of Flying,” was discovered. At Waterloo I found the free trains that",The War of the Worlds_26
36,were taking people to their homes. The first rush was already over.,The War of the Worlds_26
36,"There were few people in the train, and I was in no mood for casual",The War of the Worlds_26
36,"conversation. I got a compartment to myself, and sat with folded arms,",The War of the Worlds_26
36,looking greyly at the sunlit devastation that flowed past the windows.,The War of the Worlds_26
36,"And just outside the terminus the train jolted over temporary rails,",The War of the Worlds_26
36,and on either side of the railway the houses were blackened ruins. To,The War of the Worlds_26
36,Clapham Junction the face of London was grimy with powder of the Black,The War of the Worlds_26
36,"Smoke, in spite of two days of thunderstorms and rain, and at Clapham",The War of the Worlds_26
36,Junction the line had been wrecked again; there were hundreds of,The War of the Worlds_26
36,out-of-work clerks and shopmen working side by side with the customary,The War of the Worlds_26
36,"navvies, and we were jolted over a hasty relaying.",The War of the Worlds_26
36,,The War of the Worlds_26
36,All down the line from there the aspect of the country was gaunt and,The War of the Worlds_26
36,"unfamiliar; Wimbledon particularly had suffered. Walton, by virtue of",The War of the Worlds_26
36,"its unburned pine woods, seemed the least hurt of any place along the",The War of the Worlds_26
36,"line. The Wandle, the Mole, every little stream, was a heaped mass of",The War of the Worlds_26
36,"red weed, in appearance between butcher’s meat and pickled cabbage. The",The War of the Worlds_26
36,"Surrey pine woods were too dry, however, for the festoons of the red",The War of the Worlds_26
36,"climber. Beyond Wimbledon, within sight of the line, in certain nursery",The War of the Worlds_26
36,"grounds, were the heaped masses of earth about the sixth cylinder. A",The War of the Worlds_26
36,"number of people were standing about it, and some sappers were busy in",The War of the Worlds_26
36,"the midst of it. Over it flaunted a Union Jack, flapping cheerfully in",The War of the Worlds_26
36,the morning breeze. The nursery grounds were everywhere crimson with,The War of the Worlds_26
36,"the weed, a wide expanse of livid colour cut with purple shadows, and",The War of the Worlds_26
36,very painful to the eye. One’s gaze went with infinite relief from the,The War of the Worlds_26
36,scorched greys and sullen reds of the foreground to the blue-green,The War of the Worlds_26
36,softness of the eastward hills.,The War of the Worlds_26
36,,The War of the Worlds_26
36,The line on the London side of Woking station was still undergoing,The War of the Worlds_26
36,"repair, so I descended at Byfleet station and took the road to Maybury,",The War of the Worlds_26
36,"past the place where I and the artilleryman had talked to the hussars,",The War of the Worlds_26
36,and on by the spot where the Martian had appeared to me in the,The War of the Worlds_26
36,"thunderstorm. Here, moved by curiosity, I turned aside to find, among a",The War of the Worlds_26
36,"tangle of red fronds, the warped and broken dog cart with the whitened",The War of the Worlds_26
36,bones of the horse scattered and gnawed. For a time I stood regarding,The War of the Worlds_26
36,these vestiges. . . .,The War of the Worlds_26
36,,The War of the Worlds_26
36,"Then I returned through the pine wood, neck-high with red weed here and",The War of the Worlds_26
36,"there, to find the landlord of the Spotted Dog had already found",The War of the Worlds_26
36,"burial, and so came home past the College Arms. A man standing at an",The War of the Worlds_26
36,open cottage door greeted me by name as I passed.,The War of the Worlds_26
36,,The War of the Worlds_26
36,I looked at my house with a quick flash of hope that faded immediately.,The War of the Worlds_26
36,The door had been forced; it was unfast and was opening slowly as I,The War of the Worlds_26
36,approached.,The War of the Worlds_26
36,,The War of the Worlds_26
36,It slammed again. The curtains of my study fluttered out of the open,The War of the Worlds_26
36,window from which I and the artilleryman had watched the dawn. No one,The War of the Worlds_26
36,had closed it since. The smashed bushes were just as I had left them,The War of the Worlds_26
36,"nearly four weeks ago. I stumbled into the hall, and the house felt",The War of the Worlds_26
36,empty. The stair carpet was ruffled and discoloured where I had,The War of the Worlds_26
36,"crouched, soaked to the skin from the thunderstorm the night of the",The War of the Worlds_26
36,catastrophe. Our muddy footsteps I saw still went up the stairs.,The War of the Worlds_26
36,,The War of the Worlds_26
36,"I followed them to my study, and found lying on my writing-table still,",The War of the Worlds_26
36,"with the selenite paper weight upon it, the sheet of work I had left on",The War of the Worlds_26
36,the afternoon of the opening of the cylinder. For a space I stood,The War of the Worlds_26
36,reading over my abandoned arguments. It was a paper on the probable,The War of the Worlds_26
36,development of Moral Ideas with the development of the civilising,The War of the Worlds_26
36,process; and the last sentence was the opening of a prophecy: “In about,The War of the Worlds_26
36,"two hundred years,” I had written, “we may expect——” The sentence ended",The War of the Worlds_26
36,"abruptly. I remembered my inability to fix my mind that morning,",The War of the Worlds_26
36,"scarcely a month gone by, and how I had broken off to get my _Daily",The War of the Worlds_26
36,Chronicle_ from the newsboy. I remembered how I went down to the garden,The War of the Worlds_26
36,"gate as he came along, and how I had listened to his odd story of “Men",The War of the Worlds_26
36,from Mars.”,The War of the Worlds_26
36,,The War of the Worlds_26
36,I came down and went into the dining room. There were the mutton and,The War of the Worlds_26
36,"the bread, both far gone now in decay, and a beer bottle overturned,",The War of the Worlds_26
36,just as I and the artilleryman had left them. My home was desolate. I,The War of the Worlds_26
36,perceived the folly of the faint hope I had cherished so long. And then,The War of the Worlds_26
36,"a strange thing occurred. “It is no use,” said a voice. “The house is",The War of the Worlds_26
36,deserted. No one has been here these ten days. Do not stay here to,The War of the Worlds_26
36,torment yourself. No one escaped but you.”,The War of the Worlds_26
36,,The War of the Worlds_26
36,"I was startled. Had I spoken my thought aloud? I turned, and the French",The War of the Worlds_26
36,"window was open behind me. I made a step to it, and stood looking out.",The War of the Worlds_26
36,,The War of the Worlds_26
36,"And there, amazed and afraid, even as I stood amazed and afraid, were",The War of the Worlds_26
36,my cousin and my wife—my wife white and tearless. She gave a faint cry.,The War of the Worlds_26
36,,The War of the Worlds_26
36,"“I came,” she said. “I knew—knew——”",The War of the Worlds_26
36,,The War of the Worlds_26
36,"She put her hand to her throat—swayed. I made a step forward, and",The War of the Worlds_26
36,caught her in my arms.,The War of the Worlds_26

36,,The War of the Worlds_27
36,,The War of the Worlds_27
36,"I cannot but regret, now that I am concluding my story, how little I am",The War of the Worlds_27
36,able to contribute to the discussion of the many debatable questions,The War of the Worlds_27
36,which are still unsettled. In one respect I shall certainly provoke,The War of the Worlds_27
36,criticism. My particular province is speculative philosophy. My,The War of the Worlds_27
36,"knowledge of comparative physiology is confined to a book or two, but",The War of the Worlds_27
36,it seems to me that Carver’s suggestions as to the reason of the rapid,The War of the Worlds_27
36,death of the Martians is so probable as to be regarded almost as a,The War of the Worlds_27
36,proven conclusion. I have assumed that in the body of my narrative.,The War of the Worlds_27
36,,The War of the Worlds_27
36,"At any rate, in all the bodies of the Martians that were examined after",The War of the Worlds_27
36,"the war, no bacteria except those already known as terrestrial species",The War of the Worlds_27
36,"were found. That they did not bury any of their dead, and the reckless",The War of the Worlds_27
36,"slaughter they perpetrated, point also to an entire ignorance of the",The War of the Worlds_27
36,"putrefactive process. But probable as this seems, it is by no means a",The War of the Worlds_27
36,proven conclusion.,The War of the Worlds_27
36,,The War of the Worlds_27
36,"Neither is the composition of the Black Smoke known, which the Martians",The War of the Worlds_27
36,"used with such deadly effect, and the generator of the Heat-Rays",The War of the Worlds_27
36,remains a puzzle. The terrible disasters at the Ealing and South,The War of the Worlds_27
36,Kensington laboratories have disinclined analysts for further,The War of the Worlds_27
36,investigations upon the latter. Spectrum analysis of the black powder,The War of the Worlds_27
36,points unmistakably to the presence of an unknown element with a,The War of the Worlds_27
36,"brilliant group of three lines in the green, and it is possible that it",The War of the Worlds_27
36,combines with argon to form a compound which acts at once with deadly,The War of the Worlds_27
36,effect upon some constituent in the blood. But such unproven,The War of the Worlds_27
36,"speculations will scarcely be of interest to the general reader, to",The War of the Worlds_27
36,whom this story is addressed. None of the brown scum that drifted down,The War of the Worlds_27
36,the Thames after the destruction of Shepperton was examined at the,The War of the Worlds_27
36,"time, and now none is forthcoming.",The War of the Worlds_27
36,,The War of the Worlds_27
36,"The results of an anatomical examination of the Martians, so far as the",The War of the Worlds_27
36,"prowling dogs had left such an examination possible, I have already",The War of the Worlds_27
36,given. But everyone is familiar with the magnificent and almost,The War of the Worlds_27
36,"complete specimen in spirits at the Natural History Museum, and the",The War of the Worlds_27
36,countless drawings that have been made from it; and beyond that the,The War of the Worlds_27
36,interest of their physiology and structure is purely scientific.,The War of the Worlds_27
36,,The War of the Worlds_27
36,A question of graver and universal interest is the possibility of,The War of the Worlds_27
36,another attack from the Martians. I do not think that nearly enough,The War of the Worlds_27
36,attention is being given to this aspect of the matter. At present the,The War of the Worlds_27
36,"planet Mars is in conjunction, but with every return to opposition I,",The War of the Worlds_27
36,"for one, anticipate a renewal of their adventure. In any case, we",The War of the Worlds_27
36,should be prepared. It seems to me that it should be possible to define,The War of the Worlds_27
36,"the position of the gun from which the shots are discharged, to keep a",The War of the Worlds_27
36,"sustained watch upon this part of the planet, and to anticipate the",The War of the Worlds_27
36,arrival of the next attack.,The War of the Worlds_27
36,,The War of the Worlds_27
36,In that case the cylinder might be destroyed with dynamite or artillery,The War of the Worlds_27
36,"before it was sufficiently cool for the Martians to emerge, or they",The War of the Worlds_27
36,might be butchered by means of guns so soon as the screw opened. It,The War of the Worlds_27
36,seems to me that they have lost a vast advantage in the failure of,The War of the Worlds_27
36,their first surprise. Possibly they see it in the same light.,The War of the Worlds_27
36,,The War of the Worlds_27
36,Lessing has advanced excellent reasons for supposing that the Martians,The War of the Worlds_27
36,have actually succeeded in effecting a landing on the planet Venus.,The War of the Worlds_27
36,"Seven months ago now, Venus and Mars were in alignment with the sun;",The War of the Worlds_27
36,"that is to say, Mars was in opposition from the point of view of an",The War of the Worlds_27
36,observer on Venus. Subsequently a peculiar luminous and sinuous marking,The War of the Worlds_27
36,"appeared on the unillumined half of the inner planet, and almost",The War of the Worlds_27
36,simultaneously a faint dark mark of a similar sinuous character was,The War of the Worlds_27
36,detected upon a photograph of the Martian disk. One needs to see the,The War of the Worlds_27
36,drawings of these appearances in order to appreciate fully their,The War of the Worlds_27
36,remarkable resemblance in character.,The War of the Worlds_27
36,,The War of the Worlds_27
36,"At any rate, whether we expect another invasion or not, our views of",The War of the Worlds_27
36,the human future must be greatly modified by these events. We have,The War of the Worlds_27
36,learned now that we cannot regard this planet as being fenced in and a,The War of the Worlds_27
36,secure abiding place for Man; we can never anticipate the unseen good,The War of the Worlds_27
36,or evil that may come upon us suddenly out of space. It may be that in,The War of the Worlds_27
36,the larger design of the universe this invasion from Mars is not,The War of the Worlds_27
36,without its ultimate benefit for men; it has robbed us of that serene,The War of the Worlds_27
36,confidence in the future which is the most fruitful source of,The War of the Worlds_27
36,"decadence, the gifts to human science it has brought are enormous, and",The War of the Worlds_27
36,it has done much to promote the conception of the commonweal of,The War of the Worlds_27
36,mankind. It may be that across the immensity of space the Martians have,The War of the Worlds_27
36,"watched the fate of these pioneers of theirs and learned their lesson,",The War of the Worlds_27
36,and that on the planet Venus they have found a securer settlement. Be,The War of the Worlds_27
36,"that as it may, for many years yet there will certainly be no",The War of the Worlds_27
36,"relaxation of the eager scrutiny of the Martian disk, and those fiery",The War of the Worlds_27
36,"darts of the sky, the shooting stars, will bring with them as they fall",The War of the Worlds_27
36,an unavoidable apprehension to all the sons of men.,The War of the Worlds_27
36,,The War of the Worlds_27
36,The broadening of men’s views that has resulted can scarcely be,The War of the Worlds_27
36,exaggerated. Before the cylinder fell there was a general persuasion,The War of the Worlds_27
36,that through all the deep of space no life existed beyond the petty,The War of the Worlds_27
36,surface of our minute sphere. Now we see further. If the Martians can,The War of the Worlds_27
36,"reach Venus, there is no reason to suppose that the thing is impossible",The War of the Worlds_27
36,"for men, and when the slow cooling of the sun makes this earth",The War of the Worlds_27
36,"uninhabitable, as at last it must do, it may be that the thread of life",The War of the Worlds_27
36,that has begun here will have streamed out and caught our sister planet,The War of the Worlds_27
36,within its toils.,The War of the Worlds_27
36,,The War of the Worlds_27
36,Dim and wonderful is the vision I have conjured up in my mind of life,The War of the Worlds_27
36,spreading slowly from this little seed bed of the solar system,The War of the Worlds_27
36,throughout the inanimate vastness of sidereal space. But that is a,The War of the Worlds_27
36,"remote dream. It may be, on the other hand, that the destruction of the",The War of the Worlds_27
36,"Martians is only a reprieve. To them, and not to us, perhaps, is the",The War of the Worlds_27
36,future ordained.,The War of the Worlds_27
36,,The War of the Worlds_27
36,I must confess the stress and danger of the time have left an abiding,The War of the Worlds_27
36,sense of doubt and insecurity in my mind. I sit in my study writing by,The War of the Worlds_27
36,"lamplight, and suddenly I see again the healing valley below set with",The War of the Worlds_27
36,"writhing flames, and feel the house behind and about me empty and",The War of the Worlds_27
36,"desolate. I go out into the Byfleet Road, and vehicles pass me, a",The War of the Worlds_27
36,"butcher boy in a cart, a cabful of visitors, a workman on a bicycle,",The War of the Worlds_27
36,"children going to school, and suddenly they become vague and unreal,",The War of the Worlds_27
36,"and I hurry again with the artilleryman through the hot, brooding",The War of the Worlds_27
36,silence. Of a night I see the black powder darkening the silent,The War of the Worlds_27
36,"streets, and the contorted bodies shrouded in that layer; they rise",The War of the Worlds_27
36,"upon me tattered and dog-bitten. They gibber and grow fiercer, paler,",The War of the Worlds_27
36,"uglier, mad distortions of humanity at last, and I wake, cold and",The War of the Worlds_27
36,"wretched, in the darkness of the night.",The War of the Worlds_27
36,,The War of the Worlds_27
36,I go to London and see the busy multitudes in Fleet Street and the,The War of the Worlds_27
36,"Strand, and it comes across my mind that they are but the ghosts of the",The War of the Worlds_27
36,"past, haunting the streets that I have seen silent and wretched, going",The War of the Worlds_27
36,"to and fro, phantasms in a dead city, the mockery of life in a",The War of the Worlds_27
36,"galvanised body. And strange, too, it is to stand on Primrose Hill, as",The War of the Worlds_27
36,"I did but a day before writing this last chapter, to see the great",The War of the Worlds_27
36,"province of houses, dim and blue through the haze of the smoke and",The War of the Worlds_27
36,"mist, vanishing at last into the vague lower sky, to see the people",The War of the Worlds_27
36,"walking to and fro among the flower beds on the hill, to see the",The War of the Worlds_27
36,"sight-seers about the Martian machine that stands there still, to hear",The War of the Worlds_27
36,"the tumult of playing children, and to recall the time when I saw it",The War of the Worlds_27
36,"all bright and clear-cut, hard and silent, under the dawn of that last",The War of the Worlds_27
36,great day. . . .,The War of the Worlds_27
36,,The War of the Worlds_27
36,"And strangest of all is it to hold my wife’s hand again, and to think",The War of the Worlds_27
36,"that I have counted her, and that she has counted me, among the dead.",The War of the Worlds_27
